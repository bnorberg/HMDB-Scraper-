The mansion was sold to the Sisters of Mercy, who had come to Baltimore from Pittsburgh in 1855. By the mid-nineteenth century, German and Irish immigrants were renting rooms in the Mansion, and by 1857 a saloon was located here. It operated until 1889.
  
By the 1890’s, Russian Jews, many of them skilled tailors, rented rooms in the Mansion. It was transformed into a “sweatshop” for clothing manufacture. It continued as a sweatshop and home to immigrants into the early twentieth century.
  
In 1914, as part of the nationally sponsored Star-Spangled Banner Centennial Celebration, the Carroll Mansion was purchased by the City of Baltimore for preservation. It became the first vocational school in the city. From 1929 until 1954, the Mansion housed a recreation center.

-74.75877911,40.20056372,The World Arrives … … Trenton Thrives,"Near John Fitch Parkway (U.S. 29) , Trenton,","Just as the river has for centuries flowed across the falls of the Delaware, so have waves of people streamed into the Trenton area to settle, raise families and make a living. Still more people have passed through this hub in the landscape – along the river and roadways, across the ford, aboard ferries and over bridges.
Native Americans were drawn here by nature’s abundance. As seasonal visits turned into extended stays, American-Indian camps on the riverbanks grew into villages. Later, colonial farmers, craftsmen and merchants supported Trenton’s rise as a market town and the port of Lamberton tied the community into the regional trade network. In the 19th century, turnpikes, canals and then railroads transported Trenton into the Industrial Revolution. Manufacturing and business opportunities attracted thousands upon thousands of workers and their families from all over the world. Today, Trenton sits more squarely than ever astride the Boston-to-Washington corridor midway between New York and Philadelphia, a mosaic of ethnicity past and present.
  
1. Northwest Europeans in the 17th and 18th Centuries 
The European imprint on the Delaware valley commenced with exploration and trade with Native Americans in the mid-17th century. Dutch, Swedish and English interests vied for control, involving mariners and traders from each of these nations and other parts of western Europe. Swedes and Finns soon settled in the Lower Delaware, but fell under Dutch and then English sovereignty. In the 1670s, English Quaker settlement began in earnest, reaching up to the falls of the Delaware. 
While Quaker immigrants dominated Delaware Valley settlement into the early 18th century, they were soon joined by English, Scots, Welsh and Irish of other religious backgrounds, along with German and Dutch Protestants. Many Anglo-American settlers brought indentured servants who established their own farms after working off the obligation to their masters. British and Dutch non-Quakers also imported slaves from West Africa, usually via the Caribbean. African-Americans in the Trenton area numbered around 5% of the total population in the colonial period. Most colonial inhabitants of the Middle Delaware Valley made their living as farmers.  
2. Newcomers from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War 
In the early years of the republic, many American citizens seeking work and business opportunities moved to emerging industrial centers like Trenton. Around 1800, a small but influential immigrant group, including French displaced by the slave insurrection in Hispaniola, Portuguese and Italians, settled in the Trenton-Bordentown area, establishing a local Catholic presence. As Trenton industrialized in the 1830s and 1840s, numerous Irish workers moved into the Middle Delaware Valley to build canals and railroads. 
German immigrants flowed into the region throughout the early 19th century, their numbers increasing especially in the 1850s and 1860s. In Trenton, German management and skilled labor contributed mightily to the success of the city’s wire rope factories, foundries, machine shops and breweries. British immigration also continued into the Civil War era, with English-trained potters underpinning the rise of Trenton as the “Staffordshire of America,” and other skilled workers making their mark in the iron and steel industry and the engineering profession. From the 1860s through the 1880s, a surge of Irish workers filled job openings in the burgeoning iron and steel and pottery plants.
  
3. Immigrant Waves of the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries 
Between the 1870s and the 1920s, the immigrant population of Trenton changed from one dominated by Germans, British and Irish to one composed chiefly of southern and eastern Europeans. In 1890, roughly 11% of Trenton’s immigrants came from southern and eastern Europe; by 1910, this source area accounted for 56% of the city’s immigrants; by 1920, the number was more than 70%. Like most Europeans who sought new opportunities in America during the period, Trenton’s newcomers entered via the ports of New York and Philadelphia; from 1892, most immigrants were processed through Ellis Island. The majority of Trenton’s immigrants during this period sought work in the city’s metalworking plants, potteries and rubber factories. 
The Italians were the largest late 19th/early 20th-century immigrant group and their cultural imprint can still be seen in the city’s Chambersburg district and many outlying suburbs. In 1920, other Trenton immigrant populations exceeding 1,000 individuals were the Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Slovakian and Austrian communities, while smaller numbers of Romanians, Croatians, Slovenians, Serbs, Dalmatians, Greeks and Armenians were also present. Many Trenton neighborhoods are still imbued today with southern and eastern European ethnic influence, seen for example in churches, signs and family names.
  
4. Global Relocation Later in the 20th Century 
The influx of Europeans into Trenton tapered off in the mid-20th century owing to increasingly strict immigration restrictions, economic instability and the Depression, World War II and suburban growth. The city’s population peaked in 1950 at 128,000. From the 1930s onward, Trenton became home to increasing numbers of African-Americans relocating from the southern states for better employment opportunities. In the late 20th century, many immigrants of African origin also moved to Trenton from the Caribbean, while appreciable numbers of Africans relocated to the city direct from Africa, from countries like Nigeria and Liberia. In 1930, some 7% of Trenton’s population was African-American, in 1960, this was 23% by 2000, it was 54%. 
The city likewise welcomed a growing Hispanic community, which accounted for 22% of the city’s population in 2000. Immigrants from Puerto Rico, Mexico and other Central American countries mostly fueled this rapid growth. In the larger area of mercer County a sizable Asian community of more 17,000, composed mainly of Koreans, Indians and Pakistanis also took root by 2000, representing 5% of the county population.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4417,New Jersey Department of Transportation.,2004,"20th Century,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

Moving People 
“The long ocean trip is ended and the great unknown is before them.” 
Baltimore has always welcomed immigrants. Many have been poor and desperate, fleeing war and famine. They were seeking comfortable lives and religious freedom. At first, most were Germans and Irish. Later, they were Poles, Italians, Scandinavians, Czechs, Lithuanians, Greeks, Russians and freed Blacks. Many traveled west on the National Road, adding their ingredient to the American “melting pot.” Second only to New York, Baltimore was a doorway to a new life for
millions.

Fort Vancouver's manager, Chief Factor John McLoughlin, generously offered food, supplies, and medical treatment to the weary Americans when they arrived here. He then directed them to settle south of the Columbia River in the Willamette Valley. The Company hoped that by discouraging settlement north of the Columbia River, the river would become the international boundary between the United States and British North America.

Thousands of Irish immigrants came to Columbus to seek personal and religious freedom. With the ""Great Hunger"" in Ireland and the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal and the National Road, immigration to Columbus increased in the mid nineteenth century. They initially settled in the north side of the city in the swamp flats, where inexpensive land was available and work could be had on the railroads. Settlement spread to Franklinton, on Naghten Street, later known as ""Irish Broadway""- part of which is now Nationwide Boulevard, and to nearby Flytown. The immigrants became domestic workers, civil servants, entrepreneurs, and served the city in police and fire departments. Others were leaders in government, law, medicine, and education. Their legacy continues today in the Irish-American population of Columbus, Ohio.

At its busiest, more than 200 ferry sailings transported tens of thousands of commuters and thousands of immigrants over the New York Harbor waters every day.  In 1889, the CRRNJ built a single-story wooden ferry house, providing a functional and protective link for passengers walking between the ferry boats and the main building.  This ferry house contained four ferry slips, offices, a kitchen, staff restaurant and an emigrant waiting room.  At the turn of the century, an increase in transportation demands created a need to expand the terminal facilities. Completed in 1914, renovations included additional train tracks, the present Bush-type train shed and a two-story ferry house.  The new ferry house, built of copper and steel, was designed to accommodate the larger double-decked ferries. Passanger services located on the second floor included waiting rooms with toilets, a barber shop, drug store and newsstand.  At this time, the CRRNJ complex was the greatest concentration of rail facilities in the New York Harbor area. Up to 50,000 New York City commuters and as many as three thousand immigrants used this terminal every day.  If you had worked in New York City and lived in New Jersey in 1950, you might have traveled across the New York harbor on a ferry like this one.  To get to their trains, upper deck passengers walked along adjustable ramps, across the second floor of the ferry house and down the main staircase into the waiting room. Vehicles from the lower deck of the ferries traveled across electrically operated bridges to the vehicle concourse.

David Kalākaua was born on November 16, 1836. He succeeded to the throne on February 12, 1874, and ruled with his queen, Kapi‘olani. King Kalākaua was the catalyst for the revival and flowering of Hawaiian intellectual and artistic traditions that took place in the last quarter of the 19th century.   
He was an accomplished musician and, among other chants and songs, composed he words of “Hawai‘i Pono’i,” now the State of Hawaii’s official anthem. His motto was “Ho‘oulu lāhui” (Let the Hawaiian race flourish). He was also a skilled sailor and loved the sea. ‘Iolani Palace, the only royal palace in the United States and one of Hawai‘i’s most famous landmark, was built during his reign. 
  
Thoroughly Hawaiian but also cosmopolitan, he completed a tour around the world in 1881, including a visit to the United States in 1874, the first monarch in the world to have done so. His coronation took place on the grounds of ‘Iolani Palace on February 12, 1883. Kalākaua died on January 20, 1891. He was buried in the Royal Mausoleum in Nu‘uanu Valley on O‘ahu.

David Laamea Kamanakapuu Mahinulani Naloiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalakaua, 1836–1891. This statue of King David Kalakaua (1836–1891) was commissioned by the Oahu Kanyaku Imin Centennial Committee on behalf of the Japanese-American community in 1985 in observance of the arrival of the first ship carrying 944 Kanyaku Imin, or government-contract immigrants, from Japan to Hawaii on February 8, 1885, to work on the sugar plantations.
  
King Kalakaua visited Japan in May, 1881, on his trip around the world and appealed to Emperor Meiji to send immigrants to Hawaii to relieve the shortage of laborers on sugar plantations. This resulted in the signing of the Japan-Hawaii Labor Convention. Japanese numbering 220,000 immigrated to Hawaii from 1885 to 1924 when the Oriental Exclusion Act was enacted by the congress of the United States.
  
The Japanese-Americans, who are descendants of these immigrants, have been successful in numerous fields and prospered here in Hawaii. The King is honored as the “Father of Japanese Immigration to Hawaii.” This statue is a symbol of appreciation and Aloha to King Kalakaua, a visionary monarch, for inviting their forebears to Hawaii.

During the course of Chillicothe’s history many diverse groups have come to inhabit the area with the earliest being the Native American as early as the late 1600's. During the American Revolution, the Shawnees fought alongside the British. Shawnees believed that England would prevent the colonies from invading their land even more. Under one of their most famous leaders, Tecumseh, the Shawnee were fierce warriors. When the Shawnees divided themselves into many clans, their main chief could only come from one clan. The name of that clan was “Chillicothe.” When a village was called Chillicothe, it meant that it was home to the principal chief. Chillicothe was also the name of Ohio’s first capital, but the modern day city was not the sight of a former Shawnee town.
  
(Marker 2, French)
In 1753 French and Canadian troops seized the Ohio Valley. They promoted the Native Americans as allies of France. Many railroads in the Chillicothe area were built by French immigrants. The first European settlement in Ohio was in the drainage area of the Muskingum River and was primarily along the Scioto River.
  
(Marker 3, Irish)
The Irish population in Chillicothe was small before 1836; however, with the construction of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal around that time, the Irish immigrant population grew substantially. In 1837, Reverend Father Henry D. Juncker organized the Irish Catholic families in Chillicothe and formed St. Mary’s Catholic Church. In 1849, the congregation moved to St. Peter’s Church; however, the majority of the congregation spoke German. Therefore, the Irish members left and re-established St. Mary’s Church.
  
(Marker 4, Germans)
In the 1830's a substantial migration of Germans occurred in the United States. In 1837, a private military unit known as the German Grenadiers Guard was formed, that was part of a German movement to develop their own churches, schools, and publications. Several churches were formed including the German Evangelical Church in Chillicothe. German was spoken in several churches until World War I. German was taught in schools until it vanished after World War I.
  
(Marker 5, African Americans)
Many African Americans came to Chillicothe as former slaves or as free people of color. African Americans aided in taming the wilderness.

In the following years, a limited number of individuals and families lived in the area in private residences and lodging houses. From the beginning of Euro-American occupation, however, the area was dominated by commercial and industrial activity because of its location adjacent to a navigational river. Speculators; small businesses including saloons, fish wholesalers, bakeries and groceries; larger enterprises such as produce wholesalers, lumber wholesalers, box manufacturers, iron foundries, transportation companies, reduction plants, soap manufacturers, distilleries and warehouse companies; and City agents consisting of the Harbor Master and Poundmaster all contributed to the history of the area. 
However, the dominance of industry that inhibited residential and retail use largely ended by the 1930s. The southern waterfront’s excellent river, rail and, later, trucking facilities supported a variety of primary and secondary industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Rail and truck services, however, was not bound to the riverfront locations. Eventually, industries dependent on the rail systems also vanished when the transportation service was eliminated as a result of growing truck competition. Thus, the economic momentum provided by geography and transportation was lost. 
In the early 1960s, the new Port of Sacramento was created. This West Sacramento facility, with its deep-water channel, completely displaced the old waterfront facilities that had evolved on the Sacramento waterfront. Redevelopment efforts in the 1960s changed the physical character of the neighborhood with the leveling of many of the blocks. This left an isolated, open space which belies the bustling activity of most of the area’s history. Gone were landmarks showing the presents of the Gold Rush entrepreneurs; the many generations of hotel operators at 1323 Front Street; most of the 19th-century industries; the many laborers, including the Austrian, Italian and Greek immigrants who predominated there at the turn-of-the-century; and the river and rail traffic that produced the heatbeat of “The Docks.”

The American Revolution  [Portrait of] John Paul Jones, 1747-1742  
A bold captain--fearless even when facing the superior British Royal Navy--John Paul Jones ensured his place in American memory. 
Jones, a recent Scottish immigrant, readily accepted an appointment in the new Continental Navy following the start of the American Revolution. He captained several ships during the war and became a celebrated hero. Jones' voyage to fame became a familiar story to immigrants who succeeded through personal achievement instead of inherited right of birth.   
In 1779 while captaining the Bonhomme Richard, Jones captured the H.M.S. Serapis during a spectacular and bloody engagement fought within view of the British shore. Dubbed ""the pirate, Paul Jones,"" Jones's exploits reminded British citizens they were not immune from the effects of war. Perhaps Jones' greatest contribution toward American independence was that he became a hero precisely when the cause needed one.

-159.46555556,21.90444444,"Koloa, Birthplace of the Hawaiian Sugar Industry","On Maluhia Road (State Route 520) , Koloa, (On the right when traveling south)","The Beginning. Near this site, on September 12, 1835, William Hooper began clearing 12 acres of land to plant sugar cane. The land was part of 980 acres leased by Hooper’s employer, Ladd &amp; Co. of Honolulu. The land was leased from King Kamehameha III at $300 a year for 50 years beginning July 29, 1835.
  
Sugarcane grew in Hawaii before the Western discovery of the islands in 1788, apparently brought to Hawaii by the Polynesian voyagers who first settled the islands. But Ladd &amp; Co.’s enterprise was the first major effort to cultivate cane and manufacture sugar for sale elsewhere in Hawaii and abroad.
  
Koloa Plantation thus is the birthplace of the Hawaiian sugar industry, which was the dominant economic force in Hawaii for over a century, and more than any other factor, shared the unique multi-ethnic society of this island state.
  
A native of Boston, William Hooper came to Hawaii in 1833 at the age of 24. He had no practical experience in agriculture mechanics or sugar processing and little knowledge of native Hawaiian culture and customs. It is not surprising that he had a difficult time starting a sugar plantation. Local chiefs felt threatened by his presence and withheld vital provisions, native workers had no experience in the use of western tools and were unaccustomed to working regular hours for pay. Cultivating rocky fields and building a water power system and a grinding mil in this remote region were formidable tasks for an inexperienced manager and his equally inexperienced workers, yet they preserved and the plantation grew. On November 16, 1836, the original mill began producing sugar.
  
A century and a half later many of the fields of the original Koloa Plantation were still growing cane for McBride Company Limited. 
  
The Industry. Before Captain James Cook discovered Hawaii in 1778, the islands were isolated from most other parts of the world. Thereafter traders discovered large forests of sandalwood and began an export trade with the Orient. Whaling vessels soon made Hawaii a favored provisioning center.      
 
  Sugar gradually replaced sandalwood and whaling in the mid 19th century and became the principal industry in the islands until succeeded by the visitor industry in 1960. Sugarcane is well suited to Hawaii’s semi-tropical climate, which provides ample sunlight and heavy rainfall in windward and mountain areas. The settlement of California following the Gold Rush of 1849 created a growing market for Hawaiian sugar. 
  
Other plantations soon followed Koloa. By 1883 more than 50 plantations were producing sugar on five islands. Sugar employment reached its high point of 56,630 in 1928. Cane cultivation peaked in the 1930s at approximately 255,000 acres. Record annual production of 1,234,121 tons of raw sugar was achieved in 1966.
  
As of 1985 sugar-per-acre yields were still rising. No area of the world produces more sugar per acre of per work hour than Hawaii.
  
Five major companies gradually emerged to provide marketing, supplies and other services for the plantations and eventually came to own and manage most of them. They became known as the Big Five. In order of their founding they are C. Brewer and Company Limited, Theo. H. Davies &amp; Company Limited, Amfac Inc., Castle &amp; Cooke Inc., and Alexander &amp; Baldwin Inc.
  
In 1945 the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union was elected to represent most of the Hawaiian sugar workers. For many years they have been the most productive and richest paid agricultural workers in the world.
  
The People. For more than a century, sugar production in Hawaii was a labor intensive business. In recent years, mechanization has eliminated most manual labor. In 1984, Hawaii produced 1,061,591 tons of raw sugar with a work force of about 7500. By contrast, 56,630 workers produced 90,040 tons in 1928. 
  The first sugar workers were native Hawaiians, whose population declined drastically following the arrival of westerners, who brought diseases previously unknown in Hawaii. As a result, the growing sugar industry quickly experienced a labor shortage.
  
In 1852, the planters began recruiting laborers from China and for nearly a century thereafter searched the globe for hardy working men and women to whom the rough life of the plantation offered opportunity.
  
Following the Chinese the next major immigrant group was the Japanese. The Gannen-Mono, or first-year people, arrived in 1868 and the Kanyaku Imin, or government approved workers, in 1885. Next came the Portuguese from Madeira and the Azores in 1878; the Puerto Ricans in 1900; the Koreans in 1903; and the Filipinos in 1906, 1920, 1930, and 1946.
  
Smaller immigrant groups including the English and Scots began and arriving in the 1830s; Germans and Scandinavians from Norway, Sweden and Denmark in 1881; Poles in 1897; Spaniards in 1898, Black Americans in 1900; and Russians in 1909.
  In all approximately 350,000 immigrant men and women came to Hawaii to work in the sugar industry. Some remained with the industry for generations while others worked out their contracts and found other occupations in Hawaii. Others returned to their homelands after retirement.
  
They built an industry and created new opportunities for their children. By blending their cultures with that of the native Hawaiians, they created a uniquely rich and varied society.
  
Koloa Plantation. Koloa Plantation was operated by Ladd &amp; Co. for 13 years until January 1848, when Dr. Robert W. Wood became the new owner. In 1851, Dr. Wood appointed H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. of Honolulu as agents for the plantation. In 1871, Paul Isenberg, manager of the Lihue Plantation, bought controlling interest in the plantation and six years later conveyed it to Judge Alfred S. Hartwell, who incorporated the company as the Koloa Sugar Company. By 1888, H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. had acquired a majority of the shares and continued in control until 1918 when the Hackfeld and Koloa shares were bought by American Factors, Ltd.
  
These early years saw many innovations in plantation operation, including the development of Koloa Landing as a shipping port; start of a railroad system in 1882; purchase of a steam plow in 1893; construction of a hospital in 1910; improvements in irrigation including miles of ditches, artesian wells and a dam that created Waita Reservoir, the largest in Hawaii.
  
World War II created severe labor shortages and maintenance problems for Koloa Plantation’s aging factory and rail system. The postwar debts of Koloa could not be overcome. In January 1948 the plantation was merged with Grove Farm Company, established in 1864 by George N. Wilcox.
  
In order to process its cane at the Pa‘a Mill, Grove Farm bored a vehicular tunnel through the Haupu Range, built miles of all-weather roads, and doubled the capacity of the factory.
  
In January 1974, neighboring McBryde Sugar Company Limited, a subsidiary of Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Inc., leased the factory and lands at Koloa and moved all its milling operations to that site. As of 1985, McBryde continued to cultivate cane in fields first planted by William Hooper in 1835.
  
The Mill Site. Ladd &amp; Co. built its first sugar mill about half a mile from this site at a place called Maulili, where a dam was built to provide water power. Koa logs, set vertically, were used as grinding rollers. They quickly wore out. In 1837, a new mill was built nearby with a set of three horizontal iron rollers—the first arrangement of this kind in Hawaii.
  
The Maulili mill proved inadequate for the expanding plantation and in 1841 a new mill was buillt on this site, known then at Waihohonu. A new dam was built to provide power and a mill house, boiling house, sugar house, cart house and stable, and workmen’s houses were erected with a stone wall completely enclosing the five-acre site. This mill processed about 40 carts of cane per day from its own fields and independent growers nearby.
  
During the 1850s, centrifugal machines were installed to separate molasses from the sugar. In 1869, a steam engine was installed to grind the cane when the water failed. Other improvements were made periodically until 1897, when the factory was completely remodeled and modernized for the last time.
  
In 1913, Koloa Plantation build a new mill in Pa‘a, about a mile east of this monument site, where there was room for expansion. Some of the machinery was moved to the new factory and the monument site was abandoned after 72 years of operation.
  
Visible today are the remnants of the boiling house built in 1841. The stone chimney was the furnace, fueled by the bagasse, the residue of the cane plant after grinding. Flues directed the hot gasses to boiling pans in which cane juice was boiled until sugar crystals formed. After cooling the mass of crystals was separated in a centrifuge to produce raw or unrefined sugar.
  
The Sculpture. The concrete sculpture is circular, to suggest a mill stone opened to reveal the bronze figures inside. It is oriented to call attention to the remnants of the 1841 mill. The figures represent the eight principal ethnic groups that created the sugar industry and Hawaii’s unique society.
  
The artist, Jan Fisher, says: “I hoped to capture the faces and stances, the dignity and strength of these people. The workers are dressed as they might have been during their earliest years in Hawaii. The group expresses the cooperation between diverse peoples which made possible the development of the sugar industry and perpetuated the aloha spirit of the native Hawaiians.”
  
The first figure on the left is a Hawaiian, representing the first sugar workers. He wears a malo, holds an o‘o and sits next to his poi dog. In the background, riding upon a horse, is a Caucasian, representing the North American and European entrepreneurs and managers who started and developed the industry. Next is a Puerto Rican man carrying sugarcane. Beside him, a Chinese man squats to pick up his hoe, attired in laborer’s clothing of the Ming Dynasty. Then a Korean woman carries a large bundle of cane. A Japanese woman wears chikatabis to protect her feet and her face is shielded from the sun by a traditional hat. On her left a Portuguese woman stands barefoot, with headgear well suited for carrying any needful thing. Finally a Filipino, carrying a cane knife, represents the last major emigrant group to join the Hawaiian sugar industry.

Beginning in 1808, the defenses of the city were extended out into the harbor through the construction of new forts on Bedloes (Liberty) Island, Ellis Island, Governor’s Island, and on an island just 200 feet off the tip of Manhattan, known as the South-West Battery. Together, these forts with their heavy armament discouraged the British from attacking New York City during the War of 1812. The South-West Battery was renamed Castle Clinton in honor of Mayor DeWitt Clinton, becoming the headquarters of the Third Military District.  While its military importance declined, Castle Clinton’s value as a delightful location for recreation on the harbor increased. In 1824 it was leased by the City of New York as a place of public entertainment and renamed Castle Garden. Within a month of its opening, the Marquis de Lafayette landed here at the start of his triumphal tour of America. Presidential visits by Andrew Jackson, James Polk and Milliard Fillmore followed. The public was entertained and informed by a balloon ascension, F.B. Morse’s telegraph demonstration, and concerts such as Jenny Lind’s American debut.  In 1855, Castle Garden was leased by the State of New York to serve as the first immigrant landing depot in the United States. As the flow of immigrants became a flood following the political unrest in Europe of the 1840s and the famine in Ireland, New York took responsibility for providing immigrants with essential services such as health care, employment and transportation. More than eight million people had entered through Castle Garden by the time of its closure in 1890. The Federal government assumed responsibility for immigration control soon after, and a larger immigrant receiving facility was built on Ellis Island. Go to CastleGarden.org to see if your ancestors were among these early immigrants.  The growing demand for public education facilities and programs led to the next adaptation of Castle Clinton. The building was altered once again and re-opened in 1896 as the New York City Aquarium. Millions of visitors enjoyed seeing aquatic creatures from local waters and around the world. The Aquarium was closed in 1941 in order to make way for a new Brooklyn-Battery subway tunnel.  It was through the demolition of the Aquarium that the original walls of Castle Garden were revealed to the public. A determined group of preservationists accepted the challenges of preventing its complete destruction, leading to the designation of Castle Clinton as a National Monument following World War II.  In a similar fashion, it is the same current subway excavation that has unearthed the Battery walls and claimed for them a place on the National Register of Historic Places. It is through this ever-present need for improved transportation and safety that we have been reconnected with our past and have recognized the great the great historical importance of our surrounding walls.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=20307,Castle Clinton National Monument,,"Education,Forts, Castles","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

Politically active, Palm held a number of public offices, including Travis County Justice of the Peace, Alderman, and Postmaster. As Vice Consul to Texas for Sweden and Norway, he was instrumental in bringing thousands of Swedish immigrants to the state. In 1868 he was one of the organizers of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church (now Gethsemane Lutheran Church) in Austin.  
Swedish King Oscar II knighted Palm in 1884 for his service to Sweden and Texas’ Swedish immigrants. A devoted book collector, Palm amassed a large library which he donated to the University of Texas in 1897, increasing its holdings by over sixty percent.

Seven roofs of weighing nine tons each are cantilevered, with no nails almost 50 feet above the street.  

This is the largest single-span Chinese archway in the world, designed by Chinese-born Washington architect Alfred Liu and erected in 1986. A joint project of the governments of Washington, D.C., and and its sister city, Beijing, it marks the entrance to Washington's Chinatown in a statement of international friendship. Chinese and American craftsmen worked side by side to construct it.  

The Chinese community in Washington dates back to the 1880s, when the first immigrants settled along Pennsylvania Avenue between Third and Sixth Streets. Forced out by construction of the Federal Triangle in the 1930s, the community relocated here with the help of the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association into homes once occupied by an earlier German and Jewish immigrant population. Some of the city's oldest pre-Civil War buildings, with flat roofs and sloped roofs, can still be seen beneath the neighborhood's colorful Chinese facades.  

While many Chinese have left the area for newer homes in the city and suburbs, the community is dedicated to preserving a slice of Chinese culture downtown. Calvary Baptist Church on Eighth and H, the first to create a Chinese Sunday School here, is still involved with the community, and St. Mary's Catholic Church near Fifth and H, has regular Masses in Cantonese.

Finding it abandoned, Wayne marched down the Maumee River and was attacked by a force of Indians on August 20. Wayne's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers ended the Indian Wars of the 1790s.

This is the oldest surviving synagogue building in Washington. Constructed in 1875 by Adas Israel Congregation, and originally located at Sixth and G Streets, it served the German-Jewish immigrant shopkeepers in the neighborhood. Albert Small, a member of the congregation, grew up on Fifth Street and recalled that as a boy, “the neighborhood was our whole life [and] the synagogue was the focal point. We went to school at Seaton [Elementary], and we took our music lessons in St. Mary’s across the street from our house. We used to help in the family store two blocks away.”  

When the congregation outgrew this sanctuary in 1906, a Greek Orthodox church and later a carry-out restaurant occupied the building. Threatened with demolition in 1969, the building was moved to its present location and restored as a museum bearing the name of its benefactors Lillian and Albert Small.  

This historic synagogue symbolizes the rich immigrant history of the eastern section of Washington’s downtown. Beginning with the Irish and German craftsmen who arrived in the early 19th century to work on the government buildings, the area has been a place for newcomers from around the world to establish an economic foothold in the federal city–Jews, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Russians, Chinese, and others.  

The legacy of the neighborhood’s immigrant history surrounds you. Holy Rosary Catholic Church (founded about 1913 near its present site at Third and F Streets) served the surrounding Italian community. It still celebrates Mass in Italian. St. Mary’s Catholic Church (established in 1846), at Fifth and H Streets, founded by Germans, today holds Mass in Latin and Cantonese. St. Patrick’s Catholic Church (founded in 1794), and still located on its original site on Tenth Street between F and G, was established to serve Irish immigrants. And three former synagogues, on or near I Street, are now Baptist or African Methodist Episcopal churches serving African American congregations.

While Columbus has its share of grand houses, most residents did not live that lifestyle. Many working class people lived in hotels, apartments, tenements, cabins, and even hovels. Home ownership for the poor and working class was uncommon.  
Workers in Columbus from the 1800s through mid-1950s were typically immigrants and predominantly German. Waves of new arrivals from Italy, Ireland, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia joined the Appalachian and African-American communities. Many ethnic groups lived in segregated communities, except in Flytown. There were other working class neighborhoods such as Tintown, The Badlands, and Greek Town, etc.; but, Flytown was the largest and best remembered.  
The neighborhood was the first point of entry for many immigrants to Columbus because of its proximity to the railroads. It earned the title of Columbus' “Melting Pot.” It's cheap housing seemed to “fly-up” overnight. Men, women and children from the community worked in the buggy companies, tanneries, shoe factories, railroads, and breweries all along the river.  
Former Flytown residents tell of a mixed ethnic neighborhood with a close-knit society that truly crossed age, economic, gender, and race barriers. It's boundaries were roughly Collins Avenue on the North, Spruce Street on the South, Dennison Avenue on the east and the Olentangy River on the west. The Godman Guild, the city's oldest settlement house, provided services for the new arrivals and helped them get adjusted to life in America and Columbus.

The U.S. Congress chose Galveston over New Orleans as the site of a major new Federal immigration station in 1906.

They began arriving in Minnesota in the 1850s, drawn by rich farmland and job opportunities. Eventually they grew to become the state's third largest ethnic group, and Minnesota became a national cultural center for Norwegian Americans. Among the first to arrive were immigrants who had first settled in Wisconsin and then migrated into southeastern Minnesota. There they formed rural communities anchored by Lutheran churches, which were social and religious centers and visible links to the traditions of Norway. 

As these farming settlements grew, newcomers moved on to the prairies of central and western Minnesota. When the railroad reached Moorhead in 1872, Norwegian immigrants poured into the Red River Valley. The earliest and most numerous group of European settlers in the valley, they quickly became leaders of business and local affairs. Norwegian immigrants in the 1880s and 1890s found other employment as good farmland became scarce. Some pioneered commercial fishing on the North Shore of Lake Superior. Others gravitated to the cities and the iron ranges, where they worked in mills and mines and as domestic servants. 

To serve their growing numbers around the state, Norwegians formed their own institutions -- schools, fraternal societies like the Sons of Norway, political organizations, businesses -- that fostered the development of a Norwegian-American culture. Novelists like O. E. Rolvaag and Martha Ostenso wrote about Norwegian-American experiences. With an active Norwegian-American press as their forum, Norwegian-Americans rose to prominence in Minnesota politics, religion, and higher education. 

Immigration quotas, the Great Depression, and World War II slowed the flow of new immigrants to the state. Yet Norwegian-American culture thrives in Minnesota today, supported by such organizations and the Norwegian-American Historical Association in Northfield, thanks to an enduring interest in their heritage by Minnesota's Norwegian-Americans.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=31323,Minnesota Historical Society.,1997,"20th Century,Agriculture,Notable Places,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

-74.856253,40.094119,Columbus 500 Celebration,"Near , Bristol, ","This monument was erected by the citizens of the 140th legislative district in tribute to Christopher Columbus and those who followed him to America.  
Celebration 
We celebrate the 500th anniversary of the 1st voyage of Christopher Columbus, whose great talent, courage, and persistence helped link for the first time the nations of Europe with the Americas, encouraging further exploration and leading to the settlement of the New World, including the United States.  
Commemoration 
We commemorate especially on this occasion, people of 
Italian ancestry who followed Columbus to the New World. At first they were few in number - explorers, adventurers, missionaries, professionals, artists, &amp; artisans. They made a significant contribution in forging a new nation unique in the annals of history.  
Dedication 
We dedicate this splendid monument not only to Americans of Italian ancestry, but also to every American from all continents of the world, of every race, color &amp; creed. Living &amp; working together, their sacrifices, struggles &amp; triumphs created one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   
The First Italians in America 
Among these were the explorers Vespucci, Da Verrazano, John Cabot &amp; Tonti, Mazzei, who inspired the ideals of Jefferson; Peaker (born Paca) a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Vigo, a revolutionary war hero; Brumidi, painter of the frescos on the Capitol Rotunda; and the stone masons from the Piedmont who built the University of Virginia.  
The Era of Mass Migration 
The turn of the 20th century brought a huge wave of immigration to the United States. Between 1870 &amp; 1920, over 4 million Italians arrived to escape economic hardship and to share in the freedom, hope &amp; opportunity offered by America during its era of unparalleled industrial development.  
Toil &amp; Struggle 
Skilled workers labored as stone cutters, tailors, shoemakers, &amp; in other crafts. Others worked on the railroads, in the coal mines, quarries, and great factories. Their low paying jobs that exposed them to hazardous conditions prompted them to play a central role in the volatile history of America's labor movement.  
Assimilation 
The vast majority of Italian immigrants were Catholic. Their churches and mutual aid societies played a key role in their transition to a new society. Like other immigrant people, in spite of discrimination and exploitation, they became part of 
America's rich cultural, religious, &amp; ethnic diversity.  
Quiet Heroes 
Many Italian immigrants and their children who followed Columbus rose to greatness &amp; made significant contributions to America. But most led more simple lives. Like many of those whose names appear inscribed on this monument, these are the “quiet heroes.” Their values, example, &amp; commitment to family constitute a vital contribution to our society.

Eisendrath, a Jewish architect from Chicago, to design their home. While the Queen Anne-style house was being built, a local newspaper reporter wrote, “When completed the residence will equal in point of beauty anything of its kind west of Omaha.” That the home was the focus of considerable attention and admiration is apparent by the many news articles written about the house. The Franklin’s house was centrally heated, plumbed with hot and cold running water, and lighted by electricity; servants were summoned by electronic bells, and the owners communicated by telephone—the beau ideal of a modern American house in any urban center.  
	The Franklins moved into their elegant residence in 1893 and immediately began entertaining, including hosting a party for their only child Nathan who married Ada F. Keller on September 14 of that same year. A mere three years later, Anna Franklin hired the Chicago firm of Mitchell &amp; Halbach to redecorate the interior of the house. Soon after the house redecoration was completed, Anna’s health began to fail, and on January 10, 1902, she died.  
	Three years after Anna’s death, Harris Franklin sold the home for a token $1 to Nathan and Ada. Like his father, Nathan was an important businessman and community leader. In addition to owning the Palace Pharmacy, he was the president of First National Bank.  
Nathan and Ada Franklin raised their only child Anna Mildred (b. 1894) in the elegant home at 22 Van Buren Street. Like their parents, the younger Franklins continued to entertain in the home and also made improvements to the interior in 1904.

Under the Union banner lay the remains. A detachment of Federal troops accompanied the cortege. At the grave, E.

	“The sacrifice that we, the fathers of the slaughtered, made to our country and to liberty, is great and dolorous. We shall, however, console ourselves; we shall be proud of having offered our sons to the Union. If the glorious victory of its arms bear all the fruits that the nation and the whole of humanity justly expect to reap.” 
	The Federal troops fired a salute over the grave. The little remote site where they rest must be to the nation as sacred as those places where thousands are deposited.

Some came from American towns and cities but most were immigrants from Europe. Over fifty nationalities settled in this area. Many landed at Ellis Island and continued here by railroad before heading out to the coal camps. Some came to find work. Some to escape repression. Some to find a new life in America. All were seekers.  
What they found was not the ""paradise on Earth"" described in the broadsides distributed throughout Europe but a difficult and dangerous existence living in camps and digging coal on their hands and knees ten to twelve hours a day. Many were killed. Many more were maimed or died later of Black Lung Disease. Because coal was dug only part of the year, numerous miners established businesses and farms to provide for their families when mines were idle.  
The Weir-Pittsburg Coalfield would eventually be home to more than one hundred coal camps. At one time, this region produced a third of the nation's bituminous coal and smelted lead and zinc ore in such quantities that southeast Kansas became an industrial giant. The mix of nationalities in these camps created an ethnic geography unique to Kansas that came to be known as ""The Little Balkans."" The miners not only dug coal but gave voice and leadership to the United Mine Workers in its efforts to establish the eight-hour work day, guarantee safe working conditions, secure equal pay for equal work, create child labor laws, and implement minority and women's rights.  
This memorial is dedicated to the men and women who not only toiled to extract coal from the Earth and create a new homeland but also engaged in a courageous struggle for social reforms that advanced the cause of human and civil rights in America.

-94.707309,37.409203,Southeast Kansas Coal Mining,"On West 2nd Street, Pittsburg, (On the right when traveling west)","Phase One: Pioneer Mining 
The coal fields of Cherokee and Crawford Counties covered over 300 square miles of land, making it a prime area for coal mining. When early settlers first moved into the area in the 1800's, they were amazed to see the coal seams outcropping at the surface of the land. They could easily pick up the coal by hand to bring back to their homes as a source of energy.  
Because of its shallowness, the coal was easy to remove. Pioneer mining was done on the surface with picks and shovels, mule-drawn wagons, and scrapers.  
Early strip mining was unsophisticated and crude, but it was productive for workers. They mostly worked along the parts of the seam where the overburden was very shallow and easily removed with primitive tools.  
Another method of removing the coal at this time was ravine mining. By digging a ""gopher hole"" at a right angle to the outcropping, the miners were able to access the coal bed and extract it from the depression.  
Phase Two: Shaft Mining 
Soon pioneer mining led the way into underground or shaft mining. The first mine shaft was sunk in Cherokee County in 1894 outside of present-day Scammon. Three years later, the first shaft mine in Crawford County was sunk on the town-site of Pittsburg. Shaft mining enabled the miners to go deeper and to mine more than did the earlier methods of extraction. Shaft mining became the distinctive mode of mining from the late 1870's until the early 1930's. There were over 290 important or fairly important mines, nearly all shaft mines, in the Weir-Pittsburg coal field.  
In shaft mining there was a structure above the mine called the tipple. The tipple hoisted coal from the shaft. From there it could be screened by size and loaded into waiting railroad cars.  
Shaft mining continued for many years, but soon a new method of excavating coal was introduced with the advent of mechanized shovels.  
Phase Three: Mechanized Mining 
Mechanized mining soon became the preferred method of mining the coal from this area because the Weir-Pittsburg coal vein ran so close to the surface. To mine the coal, large electric draglines and shovels were used to excavate long strips of the land. This is why it is referred to as strip mining. The machines removed the overburden on the surface and made the coal accessible. The machines would remove some strips miles long, and the removed overburden created huge piles next to the mined strips. After one strip was exhausted, the miners moved on to the next strip and filled the previous strip with the overburden from the new one.  
Cherokee and Crawford counties have many deep pits from the strip mining days. Today many of these pits are filled with water and are used for recreational activities such as boating and fishing.  
Information from The Historical Geography of the impact of Coal Mining upon the Cherokee-Crawford Coal Field of Southeastern Kansas by William Powell.  
Did You Know... 
 • ...coal cars, like the one on display here, were mostly used in shaft mining. Hundreds of coal cars lined tracks under the surface, pulled for the most part by mules.  
 • ...native Americans and early settlers in the area, picked up the coal that outcropped at the surface to burn in their homes.  
 • ...coal outcropped east of a line from Weir to Pittsburg, giving it the name the Weir-Pittsburg Coal Field.  
 • ...the sedimentary layers of rock and mineral under the surface of Cherokee and Crawford counties is arranged in a gentle incline, dipping down in a north and west direction and getting approximately 20 feet deeper per mile.  
 • ...early miners used to take a canary into the mine with them as a safety precaution to check for bad air.  
 • ...miners had to work on their hands and knees because the ceilings in the mines weren't tall enough to accomodate a standing man.  
 • ...miners sometimes went to a mining school to learn the operating and safety procedures of the job.  
Coal Seams 
This diagram is from the book University of Kansas Geological Survey, from 1898. It shows the different layers of sedimentary rock in the area. These coal seams were found in various locations throughout the area. Some of them were unable to be mined because they were too deep and/or too thin. About two-thirds of the way down you see the Weir-Pittsburg coal seam. It was much larger than most of the surrounding coal veins, and the reason coal mining was so successful in Cherokee and Crawford counties. The seam was about 3-4 feet thick.

The Santa Fe Railroad leased the land around what is present-day Frontenac, and formed the Cherokee and Pittsburg Coal and Mining Company. In 1886, mine No. 1 was sunk and a small mining camp soon became a booming city.  
The Santa Fe Railroad advertised in many countries and soon flocks of immigrants came to work and settle in the area. Frontenac quickly became a diverse city, rich with culture.  
Frontenac Mining Disaster 
November 9, 1888 was the date of the worst mining disaster in the state of Kansas. In the Cherokee and Pittsburg Coal and Mining Company Mine No. 2, also known as Mount Carmel No. 2, a terrible explosion claimed the lives of 47 men and boys.  
The next day, the Pittsburg Headlight followed up the disaster with an extensive story, and continued to carry stories on the tragedy for many days after. The following excerpt comes from the November 10th edition of the Pittsburg Headlight.  
“Yesterday evening witnessed the most terrible holocaust that ever occurred in this mining district or the West. Mine No. 2 of the Pittsburg and Cherokee (Santa Fe) Mining Company at Frontenac blew up causing a horrible toll of life. Number of lives lost is not known. Men in the mine at the time of the explosion numbered 164. Many of them made their way out alive and uninjured.  
“At least 200 men, women and children are gathered around the shaft of the mine. The cries of those whose husbands or fathers are known to be below are heartrending. Entrance to the mine is being achieved as fast as is humanely possible, but the main entrance is absolutely blocked and imminent danger attends every attempt by the air shaft.  
“Men are driven to desperation by pitiful appeals by weeping women and girls to get their husbands and fathers and boys out before they all die. Snow and rain have been falling continuously since the explosion yesterday evening at 5 o’clock. Half-clad women shiver and huddle about the top of the shaft pleading for someone to give them tidings of their loved ones. Every available doctor from Pittsburg, Girard, Litchfield and other places from over the district are at the shaft ready to give emergency treatment.  
More than 100 men are believed to be lying dead in the mine. Those who escaped report horrifying tales of the explosion and after fire which blasted its way through the workings. The violence of the shock rocked Pittsburg and all surrounding territory. Half an hour after the explosion a ragged, bleeding man staggered into Pittsburg. He said that all the men in the mine except himself and one other had been killed. Horses quickly were harnessed to wagons and soon the villagers were hurrying through a fierce snow and sleet storm to the scene of the disaster.  
“Rescue parties have endeavored to enter the mine but have been driven back by foul air. The air fans were demolished by the explosions and men are working frantically to replace them so air can be sent into the mine.”

Peter Menghini 
Peter Menghini was born in 1885 in the Tyrol region of Italy. He came to the United States at the age of 16, traveling by train to Pittsburg, Kansas and settling in Frontenac. In 1916, Peter and his brother, Antone, founded the Menghini Coal Company with Peter taking charge of operations.  
A pioneer in the Kansas coal fields, the company owned and operated – at one time – the largest digging shovel; a Marion 300, with a 6 cubic yard bucket. The company excavated what is now the Crawford County State Park on U.S. Highway 69.  
Realizing the financial opportunities available in the mining community, the miners Peter employed were paid from the Menghini home; from there they could go next door to the family owned butcher shop to buy fresh meat and on to the Menghini Mercantile Store to get the other supplies their families needed. These financial opportunities led the brothers to other business ventures in the area, such as the Miners State Bank.  
The company strip mined until 1945 with their last dig being a 30 feet deep, 20 acre strip pit, east of Frontenac, which is used today for fishing and boating.  
Miners State Bank 
Miners State Bank was one of the first banks in the city of Frontenac. It first recieved [sic] its charter January 29, 1919, and opened for business in June of that year. The bank’s assets have grown from $105,000 in 1919 to more than $40 million today.  
When the bank first began operation, one other bank was in business in Frontenac. Miners State was named after the main industry of the area, coal mining.  
The original board of directors were John Beitzinger, Antone Menghini, Sr., Mike Papish, Joe Cinotto, Sr., Antone Roitz, William Delladio and John A. Krusic.  
The longest past officers and employees of the bank were Joseph B. Cinotto serving 33 years as cashier and executive vice-president, Mary A. Cinotto, as an officer and employee for over 60 years and Kathleen Menghini, employee for 31 years.  
When the bank moved in 1975 to its present location, the officers of the board were Antone Menghini, Jr., President; Mary A. Cinotto, Executive Vice President; Charles H. Menghini, Vice-President; Gary J. Cinotto, Cashier; Henry Menghini, Board Member, and John C. Friskel, Board Member.

In 1874 four brothers from Illinois, the Scammon brothers, pioneered new methods of mining coal in southeastern Kansas, digging the first mine shaft in Cherokee County. Although many doubted that their room-and-pillar system would work in such shallow mines, this Cherokee County mine was soon producing 40 carloads of coal a day. Within a few years, underground mining became the principal method of coal mining in southeastern Kansas.  
The Scammon brothers mined coal from the Weir-Pittsburg coal vein. Over the years, the Weir-Pittsburg was the most extensively mined coal bed in Kansas history, producing over 200 million tons.  
When the minerals were exhausted the mines were shut. During 150 years of coal mining, Kansas had produced 300 million tons of coal.  
The Stone City Mine No. 9 Disaster of 1916 
The small mining community of Stone City was rocked the afternoon of December 13, 1916. Due to accumulation of gases in an old entryway at Ryan and Reedy Mine No. 9, a terrible explosion took the lives of twenty men and boys working in the mine that day. Apparently a miner was unknowingly drilling into a gas pocket and upon breaching the wall the combination of his carbide lamp and the gas created the explosion. Although the explosion was major, most of the deaths were due to suffocation after the blast.  
The explosion was one of the worst accidents in the Weir-Pittsburg Coal Field. According to the December 15, 1916 edition of the Cherokee Sentinel, “It was a pitiful sight. The families of the miners were upon the ground and whenever a body would be brought up each would think it was their loved one. Women were panic stricken, and some of the foreign women who could not understand English were kept from the shaft with difficulty.

Big Brutus 
Designed and built by Bucyrus-Erie for the Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Company, the 1850-B, one of the world’s two largest shovels, was an engineering accomplishment. Ten years prior to construction, such a project would not have been considered feasible. Today, large capacity excavating machines have not only proven to be feasible, but absolutely essential in order to be in a competitive position to meet the production demands of growing utility and industrial markets.   
Brutus Facts: 
Height: The shovel was taller than a 16 story office building – 160 feet from the ground to the point sheave at the top of the boom.  
Power: The power plant provided 7,000 horsepower under normal operating conditions and 15,000 horsepower under peak loads, which was equivalent to power used by a community of 15,000 people.  
Movement of Shovel: Four pairs of crawlers, one at each corner of the base, propelled the machine. Each pair of crawlers or trucks were powered by a 300 horsepower motor. Each crawler tread was 5’6” wide and weighted 2008 lbs. The gear case for each truck held 2,200 gallons of gear oil. The normal propelling speed was .22 miles per hour.  
Operating Crew: Big Brutus’ operating crew consisted of only three men. One operator, one oiler, and one groundman. The operator was the person in charge of the operating crew. His job was to do the actual digging. He could swing the house with the foot pedals. The oiler was in charge of operating the oil pumps. He was responsible for monitoring all of the lubrication on the machine. He had to roam all over the shovel to insure that each area was receiving proper lubrication. The groundman’s job was to move the shovel whenever the operator signaled him to do so. He also had to insure that the pit floor was clean and level before moving the machine.  
Weight: The working weight of the machine was approximately 11,000,000 lbs.  
Revolving Frame: Size: 58 feet x 79 feet 6 inches. The body revolved on a base, supported by a roller circle 45 feet in diameter, consisting of 90 rollers each 16 inches in diameter.  
Leveling Jacks: The machine was supported on the four crawler tracks by gigantic hydraulic jacks which automatically maintained the shovel in a level working position as it moved over the uneven pit floor. The hydraulic oil was supplied to all four jacks from a central reservoir which had a capacity of 3,200 gallons. The jack cylinders are 42 inches in diameter and have a stroke of 66 inches.  
Erection Information: Period of erection was from June 1962 to May 1963. A peak number of 52 men were employed to erect the shovel. 150 railroad cars were required to ship all of the component parts of the shovel. The shovel was erected at P&amp;M’s Mine 19 near Hallowell, Kansas. Big Brutus cost about $6.5 million.  
Operating Period: The shovel ran 24 hours a day for 11 years. It ceased operations in April 1974.   
Dipper: The capacity of the dipper was 90 cu. yds. By heaping dirt on the dipper, 150 tons of overburden was handled in one scoop or enough to fill three railroad cars. It took four cables 3.5 [inches] thick, and powered by eight 500-horsepower motors, to lift the bucket. Big Brutus’ job was not to remove coal, only overburden.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=35605,Miners' Memorial.,2008,"Environment,Industry & Commerce,Man-Made Features,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

 • In 1917, he started his own deep mine a mile south of Fleming, Kansas. He and his wife, Mary, reared seven children: Raymond, Clifford, Morris, Cecil, Bernice, Bill, and Jack. The siblings and their spouses were active in the mining business during their lifetimes.  
 • In 1923, The Wilkinson Coal Company started another mine one mile north of Weir City.  
 • William Wilkinson died in 1932 and his sons continued the mining operation.  
 • Due to economic conditions and the advent of strip mining, the deep mine was closed. Cecil left the family mining operation and started working for the Kelce Brothers at the Peabody Coal Company, formerly known as the Sinclair Mining Company at Hume, Missouri.  
 • In 1935, it became evident strip mining was more profitable and the company purchased a Marion Model #37 Steam Shovel from the Joe Klaner Coal Company in Detroit and moved it to southeast Kansas. The Steam Shovel was in operation until 1953.  
 • In 1938, a 222 Page Dragline was purchased and moved from Louisiana to Weir City, Kansas where it was re-assembled and put into operation.  
 • A Walking 618 Page Dragline was purchased in 1953 from Alexandria, Louisiana and shipped by rail to Weir City from the strip mining operation. The dragline was later used for clay mining by the Mission Clay Company.  
 • In 1963, a grass fire touched off an explosion in a powder magazine at the mine. Four people were injured including Mr. and Mrs. Morris Wilkinson, and their son Bill. The fire department[s] from the communities of Pittsburg, Galena, Baxter Springs, Columbus, and Asbury came to the rescue. The explosion destroyed the tipple, machine shop, the scale house, two storage buildings and nine company trucks.  
 • The Wilkinson Coal Company continued to mine coal in Cherokee County until 1979 when EPA regulations required blending Southeast Kansas coal with Wyoming coal for a cleaner blend. It was no longer profitable to continue operation.  
 • The McNally Company and the Wilkinson Coal Company restored and preserved the Marion Model #37 Steam Shovel which rests at the Crawford County Museum. The 222 Page Dragline has been restored and preserved and can be seen at Big Brutus.  
 • The Dragline Bucket that is displayed here has been donated by the Wilkinson family.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=35606,Miners' Memorial and Wendell Lynda Wilkinson.,2008,"Industry & Commerce,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

-94.706689,37.409199,Alexander Howat,"On 2nd Street, Pittsburg, (On the right when traveling west)","Among the many significant European immigrants in Kansas history is Alexander Howat, President of District 14 of the United Mine Workers of America. He was chiefly responsible for the organization of a powerful and militant union membership in the territory of the Cherokee-Crawford coal fields.  
Alexander McWhirter Howat was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on September 10, 1876. At the age of three he emigrated with his parents to Troy, New York, moving from there to Braidwood, Illinois. Howat attended public schools until the age of ten when he took a job as a trapper boy in the Illinois coal mines. In 1889 the Howat family moved to Crawford County, Kansas, where Alexander again attended public schools for several years then worked in the mines until he was twenty-two. In 1898 Howat took employment on a cattle boat to Scotland. He worked in the mines of his native country for a year before returning to America.  
When he returned to the Kansas coal fields, Howat became an active member of the United Mine Workers of America. In 1902 he was elected as a board member for District 14. He became its vice-president in 1904 and in 1906 was elevated to president. In Howat, the Kansas coal miners found a labor leader who unified the diverse ethnic groups of southeast Kansas into a strong economic and political force. In 1918, with President Woodrow Wilson's approval, Howat served on a labor mission to Europe to help build up the morale of the working class during a critical period of World War I.  
In 1919, during a general coal strike, Alexander Howat and District 14 stood firm despite pressure from Kansas Governor Henry Allen. In response, Governor Allen implemented the Kansas Court of Industrial Relations the following year. This court was advanced as a national model for dealing with labor disputes. It made all disputes between labor and management a matter of arbitration, taking away the right of unions to call a strike. Howat was bitterly opposed to the Industrial Court and set about to discredit it. Doing so meant he would be heavily fined and forced to serve three years' imprisonment. District 14 pledged full support to their president when he called for new strikes in defiance of the law. John L. Lewis, the international president of the United Mine Workers ordered Howat to call off his strike. He refused and in 1921 was expelled from the Union. John L. Lewis, sensing a viable opponent in Howat for the international presidency of the United Mine Workers, was largely responsible for Howat's expulsion.  
Howat was reinstated to the United Mine Workers of America in 1924 and in 1928 was re-elected to the presidency of District 14. In 1930 an insurgent group of miners broke with the John L. Lewis union and elected Howat president of the Reorganized Mine Workers Union. Lewis again expelled Howat from the United Mine Workers. When the courts of Illinois dissolved the re-organized group in 1931, the power of Howat was destroyed for he was never able to regain membership into the Union Mine Workers.  
In 1931 Alexander Howat was appointed a contract investigator by the U.S. Secretary of Labor, William N. Doak. John L. Lewis used his influence to have Howat removed from his new position and from his subsequent position with the State of Kansas as a Port of Entry inspector. Defeated, but unbroken, Howat then became the publisher of a labor newspaper called the Independent News. He ended his days as a street sweeper for the city of Pittsburg. For twelve years prior to his death, Howat was the president of the Pittsburg Local Union No. 312 of the Pittsburg Building and Common Laborers. Howat's death on December 10, 1945, constituted the passing of one of the most loyal and faithful friends American labor ever had.

On December 12 of that year, 3,000 (by some reports up to 6,000) women—wives and other female relatives of striking miners—marched from the Miner’s Hall in Franklin, Kansas, to the coal fields of Crawford County in an attempt to stop scab miners (replacement workers) from reporting to work. The protest caused the governor to send a troop of Kansas cavalry to stop the marchers and made headlines across the nation. They were known as the “Amazon Army.”  
There was absolutely no fear in these women’s hearts. Like the lion they would face and fight anything bare handed—no weapon of any kind—they would face the militia—their only throught was something must be done so that their little ones would have food, something to wear in the cold, even though they might meet death at the hands of the militia.

Under his leadership congregations were established and log churches built at both East and West Koshkonong. During his pastorate (1844-1850) Dietrichson traveled widely and organized a number of other congregations in the pioneer communities of Wisconsin and Illinois.  

Both community and church prospered with the steady flow of Norwegian immigrants. Koshkonong became known as ""Queen of the Norwegian settlements in America"" and for a time in the 1870's hers was the largest single parish in the Norwegian Lutheran Church, numbering over 4300 members in the several congregations.

The earliest immigrants opened a rooming house and a grocery store. Soon afterwards, the U.S. Government passed the Chinese exclusion act (1882) which restricted Chinese immigration. However, enough Chinese remained to create a vibrant community throughout downtown El Paso. Into the early 1920s, El Paso's Chinese community was the largest in Texas.  

The Chinese contributed to the area's economy largely by growing and selling fruits and vegetables for the local market, and by opening businesses, including laundries and restaurants. The mostly-male sojourners sent earnings to families in China, with the intention of returning home.  

While retaining their native culture through language (most spoke the Toishonese Dialect), food, community associations and traditions, the newcomers also adopted area languages and customs. The immigrants experienced discrimination, but faced fewer problems here than did the Chinese in other parts of the United States.  

Chinese continued to migrate to El Paso into the 20th century. During the Mexican Revolution, General John J. Pershing brought hundreds of Chinese into the United States for their protection from racial violence. They were legally allowed to immigrate following General Pershing's petition to Congress. The Chinese continued to immigrate to the city during the great depression of the 1930s. Another wave began in the late 1940s, prompted by the communist takeover of China.

At first Christ Church met in a nearby tobacco warehouse. In 1806 parishioner William Prout donated this land to the congregation, and one year later a simple, two-story rectangular building went up, designed by Navy Yard contractor Robert Alexander. That structure still remains behind the church’s Gothic Revival façade, applied in 1849 along with a bell tower that would become a Union lookout during the Civil War. 

In early years, Christ Church’s balconies seated slaves, choir members, and Marines who were marched over on Sunday mornings from the nearby Barracks. Marine Band Director John Philip Sousa and his family were members and neighbors. 

As a boy Sousa walked to Eighth Street for music lessons. He apprenticed to the Marine Band at age 13, playing various instruments through two enlistments until age 30. After a few years spent composing and conducting, he returned in 1880 to lead the Marine Band until 1892. That year he resigned to form the Sousa Band, which toured the world and sealed his reputation. Today’s audiences continue to thrill to Sousa’s compositions, including The Stars and Stripes Forever, the official march of the United States.

Some came from American towns and cities but most were immigrants from Europe. Over fifty nationalities settled in this area. Many landed at Ellis Island and continued here by railroad before heading out to the coal camps. Some came to find work. Some to escape repression. Some to find a new life in America. All were seekers.  
What they found was not the ""Paradise on Earth"" described in the broadsides distributed throughout Europe but a difficult and dangerous existence living in camps and digging coal on their hands and knees ten to twelve hours a day. Many were killed. Many more were maimed or died later of Black Lung Disease. Because coal was dug only part of the year, numerous miners established businesses and farms to provide for their families when mines were idle.  
The Weir-Pittsburg Coalfield would eventually be home to more than 100 coal camps. At one time, this region produced a third of the nation's bituminous coal and smelted lead and zinc ore in such quantities that Southeast Kansas became an industrial giant. The mix of nationalities in these camps created an ethnic geography unique to Kansas that came to be known as ""The Little Balkans."" The miners not only dug coal but gave voice and leadership to the United Mine Workers Union in its efforts to establish the eight-hour work day, guarantee safe working conditions, secure equal pay for equal work, create child labor laws, and implement minority and women's rights.  
This memorial is dedicated to the men and women who not only toiled to extract coal from the Earth and create a new homeland but also engaged in a courageous struggle for social reforms that advanced the cause of human and civil rights in America. A diverse populace of uncommon strength, ingenuity and heart, their presence lives on in their descendants and in the businesses, farms and towns they established throughout southeast Kansas.

At the time of her loss the Phoenix carried close to 300 passengers and crewmen. Most of the passengers were Dutch immigrants bound for Sheboygan. Her burning is considered one of the worst disasters in the history of the Great Lakes.  

During the late 1840s thousands of immigrants flooded into Buffalo, New York. Most considered the water route through the Great Lakes easier than traveling overland to reach the farmlands of mid-America. Approximately 350 of these boarded the Phoenix in Buffalo on November 11, 1847, for the last trip of the shipping season.  

Built in 1845, the propeller driven Phoenix was among the latest and newest of her type. (Until that time most of the steamers built were sidewheel steamers. The first propeller-driven steamer, the Vandalia, had appeared on the Great Lakes only two years before, and most considered it a very radical departure.) Captain G.B. Sweet was in command of the vessel.  

During the stormy passage through the lakes the captain fell and suffered an incapacitating injury. The battered Phoenix entered Manitowoc Harbor November 20 to discharge a few passengers and take on fuel. Near midnight the weather cleared and the seas calmed, and the ship departed for Sheboygan, now only thirty miles away.  

After several hours of travel, passengers sighted the lights of Sheboygan, now just seven miles away. Excitement spread among the immigrants. After traveling thousands of miles, they were at the end of their journey.  

Suddenly crewmen discovered a small fire in the engine room. Overheated boilers had set the overhead wooden beams on fire. At first the crew contained the flames, but soon the fire raged out of control. The first mate gave the order to abandon ship.  

The Phoenix's two lifeboats carried 41 persons to safety, and two crewmen saved themselves by clinging to the side of the ship. All the rest perished. Entire families disappeared in the roaring flames, or beneath the frigid water. Most of those who died were children.  

The crew of the steamer Delaware, in the Sheboygan Harbor, saw the flames and set out for the disaster as soon as they could get up steam. But when rescuers arrived they found only the dead, and a burnt out drifting hulk. The ship had burned to the water line. The Phoenix towed the smoking hull to the Sheboygan Harbor, where it settled to the bottom in shallow water.  

Many survivors reported Mr. David Blish, a first class passenger, to be a hero. Mr. Blish, a merchant from Southport (now known as Kenosha), formed a bucket brigade to fight the flames, comforted lost children, helped others over the side, and refused to take a seat in a lifeboat himself. The flames finally drove him into the water, and he was last seen swimming, holding onto a small child.

Industry began to move in since building sites were cheap, railroads and highways provided transportation, and water became available. An iron foundry was established in 1870 to be followed a few years later by The United States Pipe and Foundry Company. In 1900 the Columbus Forge and Iron Company and The Commercial Paste Company built plants in Flytown. In 1901 The Franklin Lumber and Furniture Company was founded and shops were constructed by The Columbus, Piqua and Indianapolis Railroad.

The government intended it to be a buffer between lands of the Dakota and the Ojibwe and to protect the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) who had been unwillingly moved from their land in Wisconsin Territory as part of the buffer.  

Originally known as Fort Marcy and later Fort Gaines, the name was changed to Fort Ripley in 1850. Its presence encouraged further settlement of Euro-American immigrants. With demands to open more land for settlement, the fort was briefly closed, but concerns about conflict between the new immigrants and the Ojibwe caused it to be reoccupied.  

During the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 settlers took shelter in the fort’s frame buildings fearing mistakenly that the Ojibwe would join the war. A fire destroyed most of the buildings in 1877, and Fort Ripley was abandoned in 1880.

A cholera epidemic in the fall of 1853 caused the bulk of the immigrants to seek a new pathway west. Mormon wagon and handcart companies traveled from Westport, Missouri, down the Santa Fe Trail to 110-Mile Creek crossing, then across the prairie into Geary County and Fort Riley and on north to link up with the main Mormon route.  

Used heavily by Mormon wagon trains in 1854, the route descended diagonally down the face of Grant Ridge just south of Interstate 70, crossed Marshall Army Air Field and forded the Kansas River. It then crossed the Main Post portion of Fort Riley and crested the rimrock area behind the post headquarters. From there the trail ascended Custer Hill.  

The trail was used heavily by the military, settlers and freighters after the Mormons abandoned the route. The northern segment became known as the Fort Kearney Road in 1858.

Sven Anderson is credited with bringing the first cattle to this area, as well as being one of the first wheat farmers.
  
For the 1938 Marine centennial celebration, the cabin was moved to the village from its original site, The Rosengren Prairie, approximately two miles northwest of here. It is on the property that was owned by the Burris family since 1895, when Marine was known as Marine Mills. Adjacent to the cabin is the mill stream that served as a source of water power for the first commercial sawmill in the state. After the Marine centennial celebration, Tom Burris acquired the cabin and used it as a workshop in which he built boats. The cabin remained in the Burris family until the property was sold to the City of Marine in 1997. Villagers commonly refer to the cabin as ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" a name coined by Tom's nephew, Art Burris.
  
In 1998, thanks to contributions from the descendants of Sven Anderson, Institutional donors, and local residents, this old cabin was completely renovated and restored as the ""Early Settler's Cabin"" it once was, with its square-timbers dovetailed corners, and hand-cut cedar shake roof.

The cultural history of people inhabiting the western slope of the Sierras spans a period of at least 3,500 years. It is known that the Nisenan, a Native California tribe, occupied the geographic region between the Sierra Buttes, those rugged peaks outlined on the horizon, and the Consumnes River drainage to the south. As experienced hunters and gatherers, the Nisenan possessed considerable knowledge of the plants and animals of the region and utilized this information to acquire food during the summer-spring portion of their annual subsistence round. The life of the Nisenan remained unchanged until the mid-1800’s arrival of people from the eastern portion of the country, Europe and Asia.  

The Immigrants 
The first major entry of immigrants into the region occurred in 1849 when a company of men from Indiana decided to winter over on a small flat on the south bank of the South Yuba River which was given the name of “Indiana Camp.” The discovery of gold at this location insured the permanence of this camp which was renamed Washington as a patriotic gesture on the part of its citizenry on July 4, 1850. As mining operations expanded, the region became known as the Washington Mining District, and the landscape began to change as water conveyance systems were constructed. New mining camps sprang up bearing such names as Jefferson, Gaston, Maybert, Omega and Alpha. Timber was cut to provide lumber for the mines and associated buildings.  

Transportation 
The need for adequate transportation facilities surfaced quickly as the population of the region grew and the demand for supplies and services increased. Evidence of the various types of transportation employed in satisfaction of this need is still visible. Highway 20 still winds its way along Washington Ridge and closely follows the route of the Nevada and Washington Toll Road. An important way station associated with this road, the Junction House, was located to the east of this vista point.

In 1848, a small group of immigrants from the Schleswig-Holstein area of Germany arrived here, then a remote wilderness, to found New Holstein. Seeking political freedom and economic opportunity, the group left Germany because of the failing struggle for democracy and opportunity in the new land. In 1847, Calumetville hotel owner and land agent Charles White along with William Ostenfeld traveled to the Schleswig-Holstein area. Their glowing description of Wisconsin convinced a number of people to emigrate to Wisconsin. In April of 1848, White, Ostenfeld and the immigrant group sailed from Hamburg on the ship Brarens and disembarked in New York, forty days later. Traveling by steamship, train, and ox-drawn wagon, the group arrived in Calumetville within the following two weeks. On May 29th Ostenfeld and seven men walked to this location and selected their land to build farms, homes and New Holstein.

It was these three historic structures that greeted most of the immigrants arriving to the New York Harbor area during the wave of immigration of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  The Statue of Liberty, dedicated in 1886, was a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States. Its original intent was to symbolize a common belief in democracy. It quickly became a universal symbol of hope and freedom, especially to those immigrants fleeing political and religious persecution in Europe and the Soviet Union.  The Ellis Island Immigration Station opened in 1892 to process the 12 million immigrants pouring into the New York Harbor area. These people supplied the labor, and in some cases the expertise, which fueled the industrial revolution in this country. Today, over half of the people living in the U.S. can trace their ancestry back to those immigrants.  Completing the trilogy is the CRRNJ Terminal. Constructed in 1889, it was expanded to its current dimension in 1914, due to increased rail and ferry traffic. Besides transporting hundreds of thousands of commuters to New York City, the Terminal was used by about two thirds of the immigrants processed on Ellis Island, finding their way to a new life.

-93.046686,44.348122,Thomas Anderson Veblen and Kari Bunde Veblen Farmstead / History of the Veblen Farmstead,"Near Goodhue Avenue, near Nerstrand, (On the left when traveling north)","Thomas Anderson Veblen and 
Kari Bunde Veblen Farmstead
From 1866 to 1893 this farmstead was the home of the Veblen family one of the most prominent Norwegian immigrant families of the nineteenth century.
  
The most distinguishing trait of the Veblen family was its emphasis on education. Of the nine children who lived to adulthood, all but one finished secondary school, several studied on the college level, and three graduated from Carleton College. Both Andrew and Thorstein completed the Carleton curriculum in three years and then pursued postgraduate studies. Emily was reputedly the first daughter of Norwegian immigrants ever to graduate from an American college. Many of the Veblen children were teachers during at least part of their careers.
   
The most famous of them was Thorstein Bunde Veblen (1857-1929), the internationally recognized economist and social critic. He became a national literary and intellectual figure after the 1899 publication of his first book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. This book, still widely read, coined a number of new concepts, of which ""conspicuous consumption"" is best known.
   
The farm house marks a transition from the old world to the new. The exterior is in the Greek Revival style typical in the United States during much of the nineteenth century, but the full-length porch and exterior stairs derive from building traditions in the Valdres district of Norway, from which Thomas and Kari emigrated. The interior layout and decoration are predominantly Norwegian. The high level of craftsmanship evident throughout the house and barn are due primarily to Thomas, a skilled carpenter and cabinetmaker who brought his tools and talents to the new world.
  
History of the Veblen Farmstead
The Veblens lived in Wisconsin from their arrival in 1847 until 1865, when they moved to Minnesota. They were attracted to this area by the good farmland and the presence of several relatives nearby. 
  
In 1864 Thomas Veblen bought 200 acres of unimproved land surrounding this site. In 1865 he purchased another 90 acres of partly cultivated land just east of what is now Norstrand Woods State Park. The family lived in a house on the smaller farm following their arrival in July 1865.
  
Work soon began on the new house. Foundation stones were quarried in what is now Norstrand Woods State Park and hauled to this site during the winter. By the fall of 1866 the foundation walls had been completed and covered with a temporary roof. The family moved in late that year. The shell of the house was probably erected in 1867 and the house assumed its final form about 1870. The barn was erected around 1872.
  
The site operated as a farm until 1970. The homestead was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1981. The survival of the farm buildings is due principally to the efforts of the Veblen Preservation Project, which raised funds to purchase the abandoned buildings and surrounding ten acres in 1982 and which made critical repairs. In 1992 a private individual purchased the property and assumed responsibility for its restoration. Thanks to the dedication and cooperative efforts of many individuals and groups, the house of Minnesota's ""disturbing genius"" and this remarkable family has been preserved and meticulously restored as a reminder of Norwegian-American immigrant life in the last half of the nineteenth century.

The “Du Roc House” was only 175 feet due south from this monument on the road from Sacramento to Placerville. Starting on April 3, 1860 the Pony Express used this route between San Francisco and St. Louis, Missouri. The stations used by the westbound Pony Express were Sportsman Hall, El Dorado (via Placerville &amp; Diamond Springs) and Mormon Tavern.  

The U.S. Post Office, due to the Civil War, took over the prior private operation of the Pony Express and on July 1, 1861 made Placerville the Western Terminus of their Pony Express. To continue to San Francisco, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. operated their own Pony Express via Folsom from Placerville and then used the railroad to Sacramento.  

The “Du Roc House” became the new Pony Express Station from Placerville to Folsom.

Tappan and Hindman returned to Arkansas but the other fought with the Army of Tennessee at Richmond, Perryville, Stones River, Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge. Hindman rejoined them at Chickamauga and they fought together until he was wounded at Kennesaw Mountain. The rest served together until Cleburne's death at Franklin, Tennessee, in November 1864.
Hindman became commander of the military district of the Trans-Mississippi. Adams and Dobbins fought with him at Prairie Grove in December 1862.

They helped to build the City of Hartford, the roads on which their descendants would one day travel, and the buildings in which they would one day work.  
They brought with them a wide range of religious and ethnic backgrounds, and they added their trades and crafts to the city's commerce. They labored within Hartford's shipping port, offloading boats from distant cities and foreign lands. Working the freight yards, railroads and warehouses, these immigrants played an integral role in making Hartford a shining example among America's thriving metropolises. Their contribution exemplified this nation's melting pot reputation. From tenement buildings that served as dwellings and ethnic shops, the people of Front Street proudly bore their new status as Americans, while still holding dear their cultures and customs.  
Also known as Hartford's lower east side, Front Street and its side streets served as an introduction to a city that was proclaimed a jewel in this nation's crown of outstanding cities. Possibly more than any other street, Front Street has undergone numerous changes in appearance and function since the late 1800s when it served as a shipping port and commercial hub, later becoming a heavily-populated immigrant settlement in the early 1900s, and undergoing yet more changes in the early 1960s when it became a corporate center extending from the southeast tip of Constitution Plaza to the vicinity of this bridge. During that last transition, Front Street was renamed Columbus Boulevard in honor of the Italian immigrants who last occupied this avenue when it was primarily residential.  
As with the original Front Street Bridge, which stood on this spot in 1941, two ornamental medallions depicting the Charter Oak and the Old State House hang from this new bridge. Today, this bridge serves as an entrance to Hartford's newest crown jewel: Adriaen's Landing.

At its hub was the Ah Louis Store, situated among other shops, restaurants, living quarters for Chinese merchants and their families, and boarding houses for Chinese laborers.  

The mural evokes images of Chinese-American history in San Luis Obispo County, including the Ah Louis Store; thousands of laborers who built railroads, and roads connecting San Luis Obispo with San Francisco and Los Angeles; a boat bringing the Chinese to the new country; Yin and Yang to symbolize Chinese life forces in harmony with Nature; and a powerful dragon to symbolize long life.

-71.407975,41.823279,Rhode Island Irish Famine Memorial,"On Dyer Street, Providence, (On the right when traveling north)","The great famine of 1845-1851 was the most important event of the Nineteenth century Ireland. In the seven terrible years between 1845 and 1851, the potato crop, on which a large majority of the Irish people depended for their survival, failed completely or partially during their harvest season. The result of this devastating crop failure, caused by a disease commonly called ""the Blight,"" was that at least one million men, women, and children died of outright starvation or of the epidemic of diseases which came with it. Owing to the famine, the population of Ireland, a northwest European country slightly smaller than the state of Maine, was reduced by death or emigration from an estimated 8.5 million people to only 6 million. 

At the time of the famine, and for centuries before it, Ireland was not an independent country free to determine its own destiny. By virtue of English military conquest, Ireland had become part of what came to be know as the British Empire. In the process, many Irish Catholics were forced to become tenant farmers or landless laborers who survived by growing their potatoes on small, poor quality plots of land.  

When the potato crop first failed late in 1845 Britain's Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, ordered food supplies sent to Ireland for distribution to the hungry at low cost. Peel believed he had some moral obligation to help Ireland in the time of its supposed temporary distress. But this conviction was not altogether shared by the Liberal lord John Russell who succeeded Peel as Prime Minister in 1846. Russell and Sir Charles Trevelyan, his chief economic adviser for Ireland, believed that their government should take only a limited part in relieving disasters like the Great Famine. They thought that private charity of individuals and philanthropic organizations should shoulder the burden of famine relief. Accordingly, religious groups such as the Society of Friends (the Quakers) came forward to offer unconditional aid to Ireland.  

Above all, Russell believed in protecting the rights of private property owners and in the promotion of a free market economy in both Britain and Ireland. In fact the government believed so strongly in the economic principle of noninterference in trade that it allowed the export from Ireland of abundant supplies of meat and grain during all the famine years. Policies such as these outraged public opinion around the world and forced the British government, eventually, to provide direct famine relief.  

Early in 1847, ""Black '47"" as this year is known in Irish history, the British government reluctantly established soup kitchens throughout Ireland to feed people at public expense. Remarkably, these soup kitchens provided food for three million people per day during the months of their operation. Thus Britain demonstrated that it could deal effectively with the famine when it was forced by undeniable circumstances and world public opinions to do so. But at the first opportunity, Russell and Trevelyan closed the soup kitchens and left Ireland to look after itself during the remainder of the famine. The subsequent deaths of hundreds of thousands of Irish people were the responsibility of the British government and the direct result of its callous indifference to Ireland's plight, especially between 1847 and 1851.  

During the later years of the Famine many survivors were too weak or sick to work and so they could not pay rent which they owed to their landlords. It is estimated that nearly fifty thousand entire families were evicted from their homes for nonpayment of rent between 1849 and 1851 alone. For most of these people, emigration was the only alternative to death from starvation or disease on the roads or in the grim and deadly government sponsored 'workhouses"" in Ireland.  

So it was that many thousands of sick, hungry, dispossessed people-often bringing with them little more than the clothes on their backs- boarded ships bound for the United States or other countries. These small vessels, often called ""coffin ships,"" were sometimes small, unseaworthy, unsanitary, and greatly overcrowded. Numerous deaths from malnutrition and disease were not uncommon among the Irish passengers bound for America in the wake of the great Famine. It is not surprising that and Irish poet, John Boyle O'Reilly, called the Atlantic ocean "" The bowl of tears."" A new uncertain life awaited the survivors of this difficult voyage. To our benefit, many of them chose to make their life her in Rhode Island.

Some Irish-Catholic immigrants came to Rhode Island before the Great Famine. Several thousand worked on public construction projects like Fort Adams and the Blackstone canal in the 1830s. Despite backbreaking labor, they earned only a thin slice of economic salvation in exchange for a heavy loaf of discrimination. The state's Yankee population, descendants of early English settlers, despised the Irish here as much as they had within the confines of the British Isles. Ancient prejudices reappeared.  

In 1842 a civil upheaval in Rhode Island- the Dorr Rebellion- aimed to expand the right to vote to most white males, including Irish immigrants, be ending a property qualification that disqualified a majority of citizens. The reformers lost and it took more than a century to eliminate all voting barriers. The editor of the Providence Journal, also a United States Senator, wrote that Irish-Catholics in the state remained foreigners and vassals of the catholic church. He concluded that they"" cannot be assimilated.""   

The Famine Generation that sought refuge here in the 1840s and 1850s, impoverished and unskilled, supercharged the dislike of the Irish by their increasing presence. NO IRISH NEED APPLY signs pock-marked many of the state's factories and workshops, segregating these families into dead-end jobs, poverty, and drinking. Our ancestors filled the poor houses, orphanages, and unmarked graves.  

As their numbers grew, however, the Irish reset their social compass in this new land. They built magnificent places of worship, established literary and temperance societies, and flooded the Democratic party with organizers and orators. They marched proudly in an almost unbroken succession of St. Patrick's day parades, joined nationalists and independence groups to assist Irish Freedom, and welcomed revolutionaries and politicians from the ""Old Sod"" who made obligatory stops here on national tours.  

Irish women found sustenance as seamstresses, textile mill operatives, domestic servants, and teachers. They became trans-Atlantic lifelines, sending donations back home to support the struggle for independence and finance the emigration of relatives. Irish men continued to toil as laborers, factory hands, rubber workers, iron molders, and even coal miners. Both genders joined an array of labor unions that provided economic security on the long punishing journey to social respectability.  

Before the dawn of the twentieth century, the Irish became the largest ethnic group in Rhode Island, the nation's first state with a Catholic majority. Legendary political figures stood on the shoulders of their common countryman to bring power, patronage, and pride to the state's urban corridors. During the 1930s the offspring of the Great Famine faced the Great Depression. Nationally, they supported Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Locally they participated in the Bloodless Revolution in 1935 that constitutionally unseated the same politicos in charge of the state since the Dorr War in 1842. A constellation of Hibernian figures, weaned on the legend of the Irish diaspora but trained in American ways, broke the final barriers of discrimination and eventually filled every political office and occupational niche.  

In 1906 a famine refuge, Patrick J. McCarthy, became the first and only Mayor of Providence. he often ended his speeches with an impromptu rendition of the Irish patriotic song, The Wearing of the Green. When he died in 1921, McCarthy was buried under a Celtic cross in St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket. Inscribed in the headstone was a remarkable story.  

McCarthy recounted that ""landlordism and the penal laws"" forced his family from Ireland. The mayor, in death, thanked his adoptive homeland for accepting him. He concluded with an unusual plea- a voice from the tomb. He beseeched Irish descendants to never forget the sacrifices of Gaelic pioneers in the state:"" May their history be written that the future generations may learn of the heroic efforts and suffering of Irish Catholics at home and abroad for faith and fatherland.""  

As you read these words in this Hallowed place, you help fulfill McCarthy's last wish: to keep the story of our ancestors fresh and alive in the spirit though the bodies have turned to dust. We pay homage to Mayor McCarthy who made it in Rhode Island in his own lifetime-and the tens of thousands who waited in ethnic purgatory for a descendant to carry the Irish-American dream to fruition. They toiled increasingly so that we, their progeny in Rhode Island, could reach the promised land. This monument, and the energy and research that made it possible, marks the fulfillment of that vision.  

The greater the glory to Irish-Americans in Rhode Island today, who, in the name of their forebears, stand against intolerance, discrimination, and hunger suffered by the latest immigrants to our shores.

Many immigrated to the U.S., establishing communities in New York City and elsewhere along the East coast. Overcrowding in these neighborhoods coincided with growing anti-Semitic sentiment. The Galveston Movement, a humanitarian effort that brought nearly 10,000 Jewish immigrants through the Port of Galveston between 1907 and 1914, was initiated to address these issues by dispersing Jews throughout the U.S.  

Jacob Schiff, a banker and philanthropist, championed the idea of bringing Jews to the South. He was the sole donor of the plan, pledging $500,000. Galveston was chosen because its railroads and relatively small size would encourage immigrants to move elsewhere. It was also home to Rabbi Henry Cohen, leader of the local reform synagogue B'nai Israel, and a small but thriving Jewish community.   

The first ship to arrive under the plan was the S.S. Cassel, on July 1, 1907, from Bremen, Germany; 86 of the passengers were Jewish. Cohen welcomed the new immigrants, as he would every group that came during the program. The arrivals were processed at the Jewish Immigrants' Information Bureau (JIIB) headquarters. JIIB workers informed them of communities needing workers of varying skills and gave the immigrants railroad tickets and rations. More than 150 towns requested that the JIIB send skilled workers. In 1914, the program ended when the JIIB office in Galveston closed. A total of 9,332 Jews came through Galveston. While the number of Jews living in the American Midwest, South and West has never matched the numbers living in the East, the program brought thousands of Jews to places they had never imagined.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=57364,Texas Historical Commission.,2008,20th Century,"This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

East Street, Bloomington, ","Horace Greeley's New York Tribune reported on the Bloomington convention for its national readership: ""It was most emphatically a convention of the people, where all classes, opinions and shades of belief were represented---but all inspired with one common resolve to resist further aggressions of the slave power to the bitter end."" The ""shades of belief"" were broad. The old Whig Party had collapsed. New movements focused on single topics. Here in Bloomington abolitionists, gradual emancipationists, nativists, and immigrants joined in opposition to the expansion of slavery. From this wide and fractious group, Lincoln fashioned a new political party, the Republican Party. He said, while debating Douglas, ""I have supposed myself since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington... bound as a party man."" Democrats also saw the convention as driven by the slave issue. Their party newspaper, the Springfield Illinois State Register, summarized the proceedings: ""They go the entire colored platform...They put the whole black creed in the ring. Nobody will call in question the sable orthodoxy of these thugs, amalgamationists and amalgamated thugs."" Photo Foremost in the minds of those gathered at Major's Hall on May 29, 1856 was the fact of slavery. Writers in local newspapers would exclaim about slaves that, 'They are as white as you or I! Rosa, the slave girl pictured here, illustrates that fact. Taken in 1863, this photograph was sold in Central Illinois to raise funds in support of just-freed slave children in New Orleans.  While the convention was in session, the nativist Know-Nothings and the supporters of the Kansas settlers held their own meetings in town. The anti-immigrant nativists gathered as the Temple of Honor, a fraternal lodge. They spoke on temperance, a trait not common to the thousands of Germans and Irish who were settling in Illinois. Mayor Franklin Price of Bloomington, who presided undoubtedly wore his Temple of Honor regalia, as seen on the right. Gov.

What would you see?  You would be surrounded by rowhouses, apartment buildings, small businesses, and streetcars rattling down G Street toward Union Station. The homes were occupied by a rich mix of families - Jewish, Irish, Chinese, Italian, Russian, Greek, African American, and German. Holy Rosary Church, completed by Italian immigrants in 1923, stood a half-block south at Third and F Streets.  The suburbanization, freeway and federal office construction, and the 1968 riots led to the relocation of many residents.  By 1969, this triangular lot was vacant. That year the Jewish Historical Society saved the city's oldest synagogue by moving it here from Sixth and G Streets. It now stands before you as the Lillian and Albert Small Jewish Museum.  Neighborhood Businessmen Italian barber Pat Lignelli (left), Jewish tailor Simon Berman (center), and Chinese launderer Mr. Lee owned small shops along G Street in the 1930s.

City, Iowa, or Florence, Nebraska to their land of Zion in the Utah Territory. There were
653 handcarts and 50 wagons. 
Nearly 3,000 souls, some with babes in arms, and grandparents in their 70’s, pulled their worldly possessions and their fervent hopes across 1,400 miles of treeless prairie, lonely desert, icy rivers and rugged mountains. They came undaunted in their fragile two-wheeled carts, powered and fueled by muscle, unwavering faith and determination. 
The first three and the last five of the handcart companies made the journey without suffering any unusual hardship or death, but the fourth company of 500 people, under the leadership of Captain James G. Willie and the fifth company of 576 people, under the leadership of Captain Edward Martin, suffered excruciating agony through hunger, fatigue, dysentery, and death. 
“If raw courage and endurance make a story; if human kindness, helpfulness and brotherly love in the midst of raw horror and tragic suffering are worth recording, this never-to-be-forgotten episode of the Mormon Handcart migration is one of the great tales of the west and of America.” –Wm. Stenger  
A Warning Unheeded 
Upon returning from a four-year mission to Siam, India, Levi Savage Jr. arrived in Iowa City, Iowa where the Willie and Martin handcart companies were preparing to leave for Salt Lake City. He was chosen as a sub-captain over 100 immigrants in the Willie Company. These immigrants had started late from Liverpool, England and they were delayed in Iowa City while handcarts were constructed for them from unseasoned wood. They were delayed again in Florence, while they repaired the handcarts and made other last minute preparations. Levi could see that they were far too late in the season to start across the plains to Salt Lake.  
At a meeting in Florence, Levi tried to persuade the immigrants to stay in Florence until spring, but being naïve and unacquainted with the hazards they would face, and anxious to reach Salt Lake, they voted him down.  
Levi Savage then said, “Brethren and Sisters, what I have said I know to be true; but seeing you are to go forward, I will go with you, will help you all I can, will work with you, and if necessary, will die with you; but you are going too late. May God in his mercy bless and preserve us.” 
Tragedy Strikes 
For most there was the joy of fulfillment, as they reached the Salt Lake Valley, to join others who had come by ox teams and covered wagons in earlier years. For the Willie and Martin companies there was heartbreaking tragedy. Caught in the grip of an early severe winter, in the Wyoming plains, they were brought to an ill prepared delay in a fierce blizzard. Faced with deep snow, freezing weather and an exhausted food supply, they were forced to await a most heroic mass rescue the frontier had ever witnessed. 
Rescue Parties Sent Out by Brigham Young 
When word reached Brigham Young, during October Conference in Salt Lake City, he dismissed the General Conference and immediately called for volunteers. By the end of the week two-hundred-fifty wagons, loaded with food, clothing and bedding, were on the way to give relief and to bring these destitute souls to Zion. However, without food or shelter, a staggering toll of deaths occurred before help arrived.  
Of these two companies, nearly 250 died of fatigue, disease, and exposure. They were buried along the way in shallow graves. Some would have to have frozen limbs amputated, while others bore the scars of this arduous journey the rest of their lives. 
A Scene to Remember 
The desperate plight of these immigrants was recorded by a traveler in these words.
“A condition of distress met my eyes that I never saw before or since. The train of handcarts was strung out for three or four miles. There were old men pulling and tugging carts, sometimes loaded with a sick wife or children; women pulling along sick husbands; little children struggling through the mud and snow. As night came on the mud would freeze on their clothes and feet. There was no fuel to burn, except wet sagebrush, and their clothing and bedding now altogether insufficient to protect them from the bitter cold. Several who pulled handcarts by day would be placed in a mass grave the next morning.” 
The leaders and members of the Willie and Martin handcart companies have left a glowing legacy of faith, tenacity, and integrity to innumerable stalwart descendants who helped colonize historic Utah’s Dixie and are included among its residents today.  
The Savage Crossing on the Rio Virgin 
Levi Savage, Jr. owned farmland in Toquerville and LaVerkin, Utah. Some time before Hurricane and LaVerkin were colonized, Levi dug a ditch along the south side of the 
Rio Virgin and irrigated a farm about a quarter of a mile west of where LaVerkin Creek and 
Ash Creek join the Rio Virgin.  
The area that he used to cross the river became known as the “Savage Crossing.” 
Sheep men and cattlemen used this crossing to take their wagons and herds south to the Arizona Strip. The Honeymoon Trail branched at the foot of the Hurricane Cliffs and the west branch went to Washington and St. George, Utah and the north branch crossed the Rio 
Virgin at the Savage Crossing and ran north through Toquerville and on to Salt Lake City.  
Levi Savage, Jr. 
1820-1910 
“Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall find it again.” 
Levi Savage, Jr. was born on March 23, 1820 in Greenfield, Huron County, Ohio. He was the second of 15 children born to his parents. Levi joined the Mormon Battalion in 1846 and was part of the historic march through the southwest and on to San Diego. Levi moved to Toquerville, Washington County, Utah in 1865 and lived there with his three wives and family for 45 years, until his death in 1910. He was laid to rest in the Toquerville Cemetery.
  
Handcarts West 
Courage dared them rise
And face each dawning day.
Faith, it was their blanket
As at the close of each they prayed.
Courage got them moving
As ever west they went.
Faith kept them moving
Their courage and strength long spent.
And so with weary windworn hearts
They reaped as they had sown.
Faith and courage—tempered strong
And from this land, a home.
Built with courage, cemented in faith
It would survive time’s sands.
Then somewhere, somewhen, somewhy
They placed it in our hands.

-97.334558,38.261208,The Mennonites in Kansas,"On Bison Road (State Route 15) , near Goessel,","Beginning in 1874, hundreds of peace-loving Mennonite immigrants settled in central Kansas. They had left their former homes in Russia because a hundred-year-old immunity from established religious orthodoxy and military service was being threatened.  
The Alexanderwohl community, so named because of a solicitous visit by Czar Alexander I with Prussian Mennonites in 1821, had lived happily in southern Russia for more than 50 years before coming to America. Originating in the Netherlands in the 16th century, the community moved to Prussia in the 17th century and later to Russia, always seeking freedom from intolerance and persecution. Their decision to come to America and Kansas, where they chose lands in Marion, Harvey, McPherson and other nearby counties, was due largely to the efforts of the Santa Fe railroad's foreign immigration department. With them they brought the hard winter wheat which has since helped make Kansas the breadbasket of the world.  
The Alexanderwohl church is typical of many Mennonite congregations in this part of Kansas. Today these religious folk prosper in a modern world while retaining their original philosophy of freedom and manner of worship.

They came from many countries to make better lives for themselves and their children. Then, as now, the immigrants primarily worked in the fields nearby. 
Japanese immigrants wanted their children to value the traditions of their home country. In 1935 they built this school as a place to teach Japanese-American youth to appreciate the rich customs and heritage of the Japanese culture. 
Recent immigrants share the hope that their children will have pride both in the culture of their parents as well as America. The phrase used by the Japanese parents – kodomo no tame ni - “for the sake of the children” – guides the spirit and functions of the building today and into the future.  
Meet Your Guides 
I’m writing my first entry in my journal. Writing every day will help me remember all that happens in my life. (Japanese wife, left panels) 
Hello new diary! It will be fun to tell stories here. Stories about new places and new friends.(young Japanese boy, right panels)  

Arriving at a New Home (1920s)  
(left panel) 
By the 1920s, about a dozen Japanese families lived in the Castroville area. Most were farmers who leased land, though some purchased land in the name of their American-born children or formed corporations to hold land. 
May 12, 1927 
I like it here – there are other Japanese families with young children. But life is hard, just trying to make ends meet with what my husband makes farming. 
(right panel) 
Most children were Nisei, second generation. Often families moved from farm to farm. Some settled in towns like Castroville where the Japanese community slowly grew. 
May 12, 1927 
It’s fun here. There are Japanese kids like me living here. I can make new friends now that we live in this town. And I help out on the farm sometimes.  
Building a New School (1930s)  
(left panel) 
Funds were collected through the Salinas Buddhist Temple to raise money to buy the land to build a new Japanese language school. The school opened in 1936. In time one Italian girl enrolled. 
November 4, 1936 
We built a beautiful new school! It was hard work for all of us. We have religious services and weddings and funerals there. I hope that my children will learn some of the traditions and the language of my country. 
(right panel) 
The children of the Japanese community walked across the street from the public school to the Japanese school in the afternoon. They studied Japanese language and culture. 
November 4, 1936 
I don’t understand why we have to go to Japanese school after regular school when other kids are out playing. What’s really hard is we have to go on Saturdays too!  
Life in Castroville (1930s)  
(left panel) 
There was a small Japanese business district in Castroville. People in the town mixed to some degree. But there was intolerance and state laws against those born in Japan owning land. 
July 8, 1938 
I want my children to fit in and learn English and understand American ways. There are people here who don’t like us. I also do not want my children to lose family traditions – my family is still in Japan. 
 (right panel)
Immigrants from all over the world lived in Castroville. The Japanese had a big role in farming in the region, often succeeding where other had failed. 
July 8, 1938 
In my school kids’ parents come from all over. They come from Italy, Mexico and Portugal, and, of course, America. We all play together and speak English. But my family does a lot with other Japanese.  
Forced from Home (1940s)  
(left panel) 
In February 1942, armed with President Roosevelt’s Executive Order #9066, the U.S. Military excluded Japanese, Italian and German aliens from the coast. In April 1942, with 24-hour notice, all those of Japanese ancestry in Monterey County were ordered to go to the detention center at the Salinas Rodeo Grounds. 
April 30, 1942 
I’m afraid. I don’t understand what’s happening. We didn’t do anything wrong. Now we have to leave our home and we can only take what we can carry. How do I decide what to take? What will happen to our house, our crops, our belongings? 
(right panel) 
With the Exclusion Order of April 1942, the Japanese in Castroville had to leave their homes. They didn’t know where they would go, or for how long. Everyone – women and children, citizens and non-citizens – had to go. 
April 30, 1942 
I don’t want to anywhere! I’m sad about leaving my friends who aren’t Japanese. They can stay home. Why do I have to leave my pet? It’s unfair! I can’t take most of my toys and books.  

The Salinas Rodeo Grounds (1942)  
(left panel) 
The government forced 3500 people of Japanese ancestry from the Monterey Bay region to go to the temporary detention center at the Salinas Rodeo Grounds. It became a prison with barbed wire and guards. 
June 1, 1942 
They gave me tags for my bags and my children – as if my children were baggage! It’s awful here. Dirty, no privacy anywhere and it’s dangerous. I cleaned and made our barracks a “home” the best I could. We wait in long lines for everything like food, laundry, ad to use the toilets and baths. 
(right panel) 
Some people at the Rodeo Grounds lived in barracks, others slept in stables. The wall were so thin, they heard their neighbors’ every word. They had no idea how long they’d be there. 
June 1, 1942 
I’m hungry a lot here. I don’t like the food and eating with all those people. My mother is so sad here. But we don’t have school and I get to play with new friends. What will happen tow us next?  

Life in Camp (1942-1943)  
(left panel) 
On July 4th, 1942, the Japanese-Americans at the Rodeo Grounds were loaded onto trains and shipped to the Poston, Arizona prison camp. They lived behind barbed wire in the hot desert for most of the war years. They’d lost everything of their former lives. 
January 18, 1945 
We lived for three years in the dusty desert, in the middle of nowhere with thousands of others far from home. We did nothing wrong. They put us in concentration camps because we had Japanese blood, even if we were citizens. 
(right panel) 
Some men left camp and fought and died in the war in the all Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Others were allowed to go work in the fields in the Midwest and elsewhere. When the camps closed, the detainees didn’t know what would happen to them. 
January 18, 1945 
I’m glad to be getting out of that empty desert place – so dusty and full of rattlesnakes! The war made some people think we were the enemy. We’re not! Our soldiers in the 442nd are heroes of the war!  

Moving On (1945)  
(left panel) 
After the war, people had to start their lives all over again. Most had lost everything and had no money. Finding jobs and housing was a big challenge for most families. 
April 19, 1952 
We didn’t know where to go. Salinas was hard: some people wouldn’t sell us gas or food, or give us a place to live or work. Some went to Monterey where people were friendlier. They worked in canneries or as gardeners. We’re making a new life. 
(right panel) 
The returning Japanese community met prejudice wherever they went. It was hard to find work and they did any work they could get. Some people offered help and things slowly got easier. 
April 19, 1952 
It’s hard being back in school. Everything and everyone has changed. Some kids are mean and call us names. Some are nice though. And it gets better. Now I like being with all kinds of different people.  

The Order to Leave Home Came in April, 1942  
Four months after the Japanese military bombed Pearl Harbor, the Exclusion Order came. The U.S. government told all those of Japanese ancestry living in Monterey County to leave their homes.  
Families made hard decisions about what to take and what to leave behind. They went to the detention center at the Salinas Rodeo Grounds with fear and uncertainty.

Knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world.

Before becoming a Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein had already become famous for his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905 and General Theory of Relativity in 1915-1916, both of which explained fundamental laws of the universe. His name became synonymous with genius.  A Nobel Laureate in physics, a philosopher, a humanitarian, an educator, and an immigrant, Albert Einstein left an indelible mark on the world and expressed tremendous appreciation for Princeton.   “I am privileged by fate to live here in Princeton,” Einstein wrote. “I feel doubly thankful that there has fallen on my lot a place for work and a scientific atmosphere which could not be better or more harmonious.”  ( Base of Monument : ) Physicist • Humanitarian • Educator • Immigrant  ( Left Side Inscription : ) The ideals which have lighted my way and time after time have given me the energy to face life have been Kindness, Beauty and Truth (1930)  ( Rear Inscription : ) America today is the hope of all honorable men who respect the rights of their fellow men and who believe in the principles of freedom and justice.

They emigrated from the counties of Bischofteinitz, Mies and Taus in the province of Pilsen, as shown on the European map and settled in the townships sketched on the U.S. map. Around the base in the granite slabs are inscribed the over 350 immigrant family names as they were approximately spelled when the families departed their old homeland. Known at the time of their departure as Bohemia, a crown colony in the Austro-Hungarian empire, this region in the 20th century was included in the larger periphery of the Czech nation designated as the Sudetenland, more locally it was called the Bohmerwald Bohemian Forest, a ridge of high hills that forms a natural border with Germany. 
  
The immigrants came mostly from small villages with the largest numbers from the village centers of Hostau, Muttersdorf and Ronsberg. These were farm communities where the people lived and housed their stock, going out daily to work their scattered non-contiguous fields. Most villages had Catholic churches or chapels and the residents spoke a Bohemian dialect of German. From New Years day to Christmas each year they observed special traditions spiced with large wedding celebrations and funerals attended by the entire communities. Music in every form--bands, singing societies, and choirs--permeated all the aspects of village life. 
  
Many German-Bohemian traditions crossed the ocean to the New Ulm region. Some immigrants from Bohemia were among the earliest farm settlers arriving by ship on the Minnesota River within two years after German Turners founded the city. Beginning in 1856 they farmed in Cottonwood Township, then extended their settlement northward into St. George and westward into Sigel Township, Sleepy Eye and farther west. As more and more arrived (after 1872 by rail) they could no longer all farm. Beginning around 1880 they acquired homes especially in the southeast section of the city of New Ulm, an area they affectionately called the Ganseviertel, Goosetown. They also concentrated in the Wallachei (Low Land) region to the west. Farther north in the city, retired farmers built homes near Trinity Catholic Church. Younger city dwellers often labored in the roller mills, the breweries and as carpenters, masons and cigar makers. Among them in later years were also doctors, painters, musicians, butchers and blacksmiths. Many women eared extra money Klopping (making lace) and sewing feather-filled bedding.

After attacking the Redwood (Lower Sioux) Agency on August 18 — the beginning of what became known as the U.S.–Dakota War of 1862 — the Dakota moved toward New Ulm. In their path stood a small settlement known as Milford. There, unprepared for battle, 53 of Milford’s residents were killed in a single day. As farms burned, the survivors of those families fled, raising the alarm for the citizens of New Ulm about what lay ahead. Following are some of their stories.
  
 Henle Family  
The Henle family lost more than two dozen of their extended family in the U.S.−Dakota War — more than any other immigrant family in Brown County. Farmers and innkeepers Anton and Theresia Henle were lucky to escape with their lives. Anton, gone from Milford for the day with U.S. Army soldiers seeking Civil War recruits, escaped a Dakota ambush nearby. Theresia, left at home, witnessed much bloodshed. Among those killed that day were her mother and three of her own children. When Anton made his way back to Milford at day’s end, he was grateful to find his wife alive.
  
Haeberle Family
Brothers Jacob, Leonhard and David Haeberle settled on neighboring farms in Milford Township in 1855. Jacob, one of the many local German immigrants, was given the honor of naming the nearby town of New Ulm after the area in Germany from which many had come. When war broke out on August 18, 1862, the close-knit Haeberle family fought to defend their homes. The next day, Jacob fought again at New Ulm, suffering a wound that took his life several months later. Leonhard, disabled from his injuries, died a few years after. Their brother David survived the attack but lost a son in 
the fighting.
  
Schilling Family
Carl ""Adolph"" Schilling, an immigrant from northern Germany, brought his family to Milford in 1857 after buying land to homestead in the small farming community. An account of the Schilling family’s fate survives in the record of postwar trials. Joseph Godfrey, a mixed-blood of French Canadian and black heritage married to a Dakota woman, testified that he was forced by some Dakota to attack the Schilling family while they ate dinner. After he broke in and hit Adolph, the Dakota followed, firing their rifles. Adolph died in the attack. A son, Fritz, died later from his wounds. Adolph’s wife, Christina, also was wounded but survived.
  
Massopust Family
Among the scouting party that founded New Ulm in 1854 was Franz Massopust Jr., from Bohemia by way of New York and Chicago. Two years after his 1855 marriage to Ernestine Klingbeil, Franz’s extended German-Bohemian family left Europe to join him in Milford. In 1862 they found themselves caught in the middle of the attack on their community. In all, four family members lost their lives on August 18. Franz survived the fighting, only to die of typhoid fever three years later.
  
The Dakota, too, would pay a heavy price. An unknown number were killed during the six-week war, and hundreds more died later in prison camps or during their exile from the state. There are few written accounts of those hardships. Their stories remain to be told.

It was these three historic structures that greeted most of the immigrants arriving to the New York Harbor area during the wave of immigration of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  The Statue of Liberty, dedicated in 1886, was a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States. Its original intent was to symbolize a common belief in democracy. It quickly became a universal symbol of hope and freedom, especially to those immigrants fleeing political and religious persecution in Europe and the Soviet Union.  The Ellis Island Immigration Station opened in 1892 to process the 12 million immigrants pouring into the New York Harbor area. These people supplied the labor, and in some cases the expertise, which fueled the industrial revolution in this country. Today, over half of the people living in the U.S. can trace their ancestry back to those immigrants.  Completing the trilogy is the CRRNJ Terminal. Constructed in 1889, it was expanded to its current dimension in 1914, due to increased rail and ferry traffic. Besides transporting hundreds of thousands of commuters to New York City, the Terminal was used by about two thirds of the immigrants processed on Ellis Island, finding their way to a new life.

Following its 1855 completion, the Fort’s primary role was to assist the federal government with an orderly transition of land ownership from American Indians to the growing number of European immigrant farmers. Nothing in that definition suggests the need for a stockade for defense against dramatic attacks. 
  
Yet that is what happened. When the six-week U.S.-Dakota War began in August, 1862, the fort assumed great importance as the only military post in the area. On August 20 and 22, 1862, as many as 400 Dakota warriors attacked the fort, defended by just 280 soldiers and refugees. The use of artillery compensated for the lack of a stockade and for the fort’s vulnerable location, compelling Dakota forces to withdraw. 
  
Up until the events that led to war in 1862, loneliness and boredom afflicted the Fort Ridgely soldiers: records described complaints about housekeeping detail and harsh winters. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Minnesota’s citizen soldiers relieved regular Army soldiers needed in the South. When the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 erupted, those same volunteer soldiers were among the first to respond and the first to fall in combat. Hundreds of European immigrant families fled to Fort Ridgely for protection.
  
The U.S. military abandoned the fort in 1872, and most of the buildings deteriorated or were converted for other uses. The state erected a battle monument in 1896. In 1911, the Minnesota Legislature created Fort Ridgely State Park. Excavations in 1935 revealed eight building foundations. The fort’s stone commissary was preserved and today serves as a visitor center.

Simple Lifestyles 
One room housed the whole family. The loft was used for sleeping. Family activities centered around the hearth. The house was lighted by only two windows, making it dark and dreary in the winter.  
Notice that there is no landscaping. That was a luxury for which early settlers has no extra time. Their time was devoted to the essentials of life.

Jacob Snyder, a German immigrant, built the house in 1855. In 1860, he sold it to Franz and Hanna Grusendorf. Franz Grusendorf was a stone mason who built the foundations and walls of many houses and farm buildings of the time in the Germantown area.  
The Grusendorf house is typical of early 19th century homes built by German farmers who settled in the region. The cabin has V-notched logs which once chinked with fieldstone and clay (however the preserved structure utilizes a formula that includes modern day concrete.)

Historic newspapers, old deeds and early maps help us piece together some of the earliest place names of our city.   
Parts of Danbury were lost to Bethel when it broke away in 1855 including Pinchgut, Wolfpits, and Puppytown. Other colorful names have simply disappeared over time such as Mashing Tub Swamp and Stubble-lot Road.   
The Borough of Danbury began to officially name its streets in 1846 and by 1878 Towne Street had become Main Street. Barren Plain Road changed to White Street, Horse Island Lane is now Liberty Street and Whittlesey Lane became New Street.   
The two oldest street names in Danbury belong to Town Hill Avenue and Deer Hill Avenue. These names were given in the earliest years to the ridges running east and west of the original settlements along the southern end of Main Street.   
Park Avenue was known as Squabble Hill for a time. The name came from a Revolutionary War tale of a man named Porter and his encounter with British troops. Upper Elm Street was once called Rabbit Hill due to the hordes of the cottontail creatures that lived there in the gravel pits. Beaver Street was labeled Gallows Hill.   
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the area of Elm, Spring and New Streets was called ‘Little Lebanon’ having been populated by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. Slovaks lived in neighborhoods near Lake Avenue and Golden Hill. Portuguese families settled in the mainly Italian ‘Barbary Coast’ section of lower Liberty Street.

Germans immigrants were the first major group to speak a foreign language in town. The majority worked as hatters. Immanuel Lutheran Church was founded in 1881 and in 1882 the church founded Danbury’s first parochial school.  
The first Italians arrived in the 1880s and were employed as work crews for railroad and public works projects. Many established local businesses. Nearly half a dozen Italian fraternal groups were formed by the end of the 1800s. Italians set down the roots for what would become the city’s largest ethnic community. In 1913 all of the city’s Italian clubs combined to form the Amerigo Vespucci Lodge, Sons of Italy, the largest organization of its kind in Connecticut.  
Poles and Slovaks in large numbers were drawn to Danbury; attracted by jobs in the hatting industry and on local farms. Eastern European immigrants founded St. Paul Slovak Lutheran Church, St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church and Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church.

In the early days the marshy Tiber Creek ran between what are now North Capitol and First Streets, NE. Legend has it that lingering rain puddles (""poodles"") led to the neighborhood's nickname.  Swampoodle's earliest residents, mostly Irish immigrants and free African Americans, helped build this city. Their hands crafted the White House and the Capitol, among other buildings. Swampoodle grew during the Civil War (1861-1865), when more once-enslaved people arrived seeking work. In the 1880s Italian stonecarvers and masons found affordable lodging here while building the Library of Congress, Union Station, and the National Cathedral.  In the early 1900s, Congress located Union Station in Swampoodle. Hundreds of homes and businesses disappeared as railroad tracks were laid and the station rose. Many of the displaced moved east, settling today's H Street corridor.  Soon the city rezoned the remaining Swampoodle area for commercial/industrial use. Railroad, Government Printing Office, light industry, and Post Office jobs made nearby H Street attractive to more families.  Swampoodle's large immigrant Catholic population drew two institutions honorong Jesuit Saint Aloysius Gonzaga: St. Aloysius Catholic Church, dedicated in 1859, and Gonzaga College High School, founded in 1821 and relocated beside the church on North Capitol Street in 1871.  In the early 1950s, Father Horace McKenna revived a shrinking St. Aloysius, refocusing it to serve the neediest.

Farm families, merchants, craftsmen, town developers and dreamers saw great opportunities in the valley. Some merchants and promoters, such as Brown, found success in the valley in supplying provisions and transportation for this westward movement. Others did not survive the rigors of pioneer life. Many returned on to Colorado, Oregon and California.
  
As settlers' farms displaced the traditional hunting grounds of the Dakota, some Dakota people accepted the immigrants' religions and farming practices. Following the 1862 U.S.–Dakota War, the Dakota people experienced the loss of both traditional and newly adopted lifestyles as they were forced onto reservations further west.

One of the park’s greatest contributions to the growth of Pensacola was its connection with the creation of the city’s first public transportation system. An astute businessman, Kupfrian was one of the founding owners of the Pensacola Street Car Company, and he made certain that the company’s service extended two miles northwest of the city center to terminate at his park’s main gate.

Farmers dominated until the Civil War. Then in the 1890s electric streetcars allowed government workers to live here and ride to jobs downtown. By the 1940s, sons and daughters of Jewish, Greek, and Italian immigrants had arrived, often leaving crowded conditions in older neighborhoods.
  
Abraham Posin, founder of Posin's Deli and Bakery, was typical of the newcomers. His family had immigrated from Russia around 1910. Young Abraham visited an uncle living in Washington, where he met and married Gertrude Rose, another Russian émigré. The couple opened a store in Foggy Bottom. Posin's followed its Jewish customers' northward migration, first to the Arcade Market in Columbia Heights. Finally it opened here in 1947 at 5657 Georgia Avenue. Abe's sons, World War II veterans Max and Hyman, eventually took over the store.
  
Although most of his Jewish customers moved on in the 1950s, Max stayed to serve the African Americans and Caribbean immigrants who took their places. Everyone was welcome. Max died in 1995, and his son Randy closed the store three years later.
  
The Firehouse just beyond Posin's is here because, back in 1891, residents formed the Brightwood Citizens' Association and lobbied for city-style improvements. In addition to the firehouse, they secured sewers, sidewalks, streets, electric and gas service, and an elementary school.

Teachers required good behavior, good grammar, and respect for the historic contributions of black Americans. Tyson traveled from Montgomery County, Maryland, to attend.

The Italian Renaissance style school, designed by Snowden Ashford, held four classrooms. After the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v.

The group wintered in Syracuse, New York, before continuing its journey to “Black Lake County” (present-day Lake Macatawa) in Michigan. The Overisel settlers joined Dutch immigrants in the Holland settlement in June, 1848. They selected land and pooled the gold they had brought with them to purchase 2,000 acres of land from the government and speculators.

In June of that year a separate group of seventy people from Graafschap Betheim, near the Dutch border, founded this village which they named Graafschap. Joined by thirty-four other immigrants from Drente, the Netherlands, the villagers shared common religious views and spoke similar dialects. Before erecting a log church in 1849 near this site, these early settlers attended services conducted by Van Raalte in nearby Holland. Graafschap followed Van Raalte's example by affiliating with the Reformed Church in America in 1850. Seven years later the congregation severed that tie and reasserted its independence.

Those who established this church were among thousands of Europeans who sought to escape religious and political persecution and economic depression by emigrating to America in the 1840s. Later Graafschap was one of the founding members of the Christian Reformed Church which bound itself closely to Dutch customs and ways of thinking, as evidenced by the fact that this church's parishioners continued to speak Dutch for two generations.

A tangle of birch and balsam fir, with pale blossoms of climbing fumitory, grow on the island, too. Long ago, people lived on Horseshoe Island.
  
Indian people, including the ancestors of the Menomini, have lived in this area for over 2,500 years. In historic times other tribes visited Horseshoe Island, including Potawatomi. They fished for sturgeon and lake trout, no doubt finding refuge from storms in Horseshoe Island's south facing harbor. In 1850, Norwegian immigrant Ole Larsen settled here. Larsen supplied boiler fuel wood for vessels sailing Green Bay waters.
  
Later, the island captured the imagination of a wealthy Nebraska family, the Foldas. Bankers by trade, they purchased Horseshoe Island for $500 in 1888. When the State of Wisconsin established Peninsula State Park in 1909, E.F. Folda negotiated a selling price of $5,000 and a life estate for himself as well as his wife and sister. In time, he built an impressive summer lodge, Engelmar. But Folda fell on hard times during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He sold and moved the lodge and all other island possessions. When he died in 1944, his widow, Alma, relinquished ownership.
  
Today, Horseshoe Island is part of Peninsula State Park. Only the alert visitor will detect the lodge foundation, a root cellar, and openings where gardens once thrived.

When the Canadian immigration complex known as Pier 21 closed its doors in March of 1971, it marked the end of a more than forty-year saga of human hope, vision, courage and resilience. From its opening on the Halifax waterfront in 1928 to its final months of operation, Pier 21 served as a bridge to new beginnings. More than a million immigrants, refugees, displaced persons and war brides passed through its transit shed on their way to becoming Canadian citizens. During the Second World War, over 494,000 Canadian troops departed from Pier 21 to serve overseas.  
In the early 1980’s, volunteers championed the sentiments that this landmark ought to be preserved as a tribute to the men, women and children who passed through its halls in quest of new lives in a new land. On July 1, 1999 the immigrant shed re-opened its doors as a National Historic Site. Thanks to the generous support of government and the private sector, Pier 212 is now a stunning, 40,000 square feet multi-media interpretation centre.  
Today, Pier 21 blends state-of-the-art interactive displays, films and photographs, historic artifacts and commemorative elements. The experience is informative and profoundly moving. Highlights include the Rudolph Peter Bratty Exhibition Hall and its interactive exhibit focusing on the personal journey of those passing through the immigration sheds as well as the Bell Canada Ship Database and the Secunda Marine Wall of Ships. Visitors can chose to honour family or friends at Pier 212 by purchasing a brick on the Sobey Wall of Honour or Wall of Service.

Opened in 1928, Pier 21 served as one of Canada’s principal reception centres for immigrants until it closed in 1971. It typifies the large, self-contained immigrant facilities that the Government of Canada had begun to establish at major ports near the turn of the 20th century. The staff at Pier 21 handled large volumes of immigrants rapidly, checking their citizenship and medical condition, and providing quarantine, detention, customs and social services.

Ouvert en 1928, le complexe est représentatif des vastes installations créées par le gouvernement canadien dans les principaux portes au tournant du XXᵉ siècle pour assure l’admission rapide d’une multitude d’immigrants.

Postwar Immigration / L’immigration de L’aprés-guerre 
English 
In the decade immediately following the Second World War, Canada received about one and a quarter million immigrants from Europe. The newcomers consisted of dependents of returning Canadian service men, a people dislocated by the conflict and its aftermath in their homelands. Most of them arrived by sea, with Halifax serving as the major port of entry. Here, at Pier 21, reception facilities served the immigrants as the first point of contact with their new country. The successful integration of these new Canadians was at once a cause and a consequence of Canada’s postwar prosperity.  
French 
Au cours de la décennie qui suivit la Seconde Guerre mondiale, le Canada accueillit environs 1,25 million d’immigrants européens : les families de soldats canadiens tout d’abord, puis les personnes déplacées par le conflit et ses suites dans leur pays d’origine. Le plupart de ces immigrants, arrivés par bateau, débarquèrent à Halifax, et le centre d’accueil de quai 21 fut leur premier point de contact avec leur pays d’adoption. Le succès de leur integration à la société canadienne fut à la fois une cause et un effet de la prospérité que connut le Canada après la guerre.

Between 1942 and 1948 some 48,000 women, accompanied by 22,000 children, mostly from Great Britain, landed here at Pier 21 as wives of Canadian servicemen stationed abroad during the Second World War. The high number of these wartime romances prompted the federal government to provide the new spouses with transportation to Canada and information about their adopted country. Across Canada, war bride clubs helped the women adapt to new customs and surroundings. In the succeeding generations, the war brides collectively strengthened many Canadian’s emotional links with Britain.

Dakota people had hunting and fishing camps in Kandiyohi County before the American and European immigrants came. These immigrants had to learn how to co-exist with the Dakota.

Celebrating Canada’s Immigrants 
In the 1940s and 1950s, Canada opened its doors wide to European immigrants. With haunting wartime memories still fresh in their minds, men, women and children from diverse countries and cultures arrived at Halifax, Saint John and Quebec City.  
After a voyage of a week or more across the North Atlantic many disembarked confused and exhausted, clutching their worldly possessions. Some were eager to explore their new country, while others faced a new world and a new life with anticipation. Caring members of religious and social group, volunteers and government staff provided spiritual, material and moral support to the new arrivals. Within hours, the majority of immigrants were on trains bound for new beginnings throughout Canada.  
Canada’s welcome was not always universal. Some immigrants never got past Pier 21. They were rejected for medical reasons or because of their ethnic origins and deported. Even among those who were accepted, some would encounter discrimination and hatred. Nevertheless, they persevered, survived and prospered.  
Like those before them, and those who have followed, postwar immigrants have helped to define our national identity and society by enriching the cultural diversity of Canada, to the benefit of all Canadians.

Hommage aux immigrants canadiens 
Dans les années 1940 et 1950, le Canada accueille à bras ouverts les immigrants en provenance de l’Europe. Encore hantés par le souvenir de la guerre récente, des hommes, des femmes et des enfants de divers pays et cultures arrivent à Halifax, à Saint-Jean (N.-B.) et à Québec.  

Après un voyage d’une semaine ou plue à travers l’Atlantique nord, bon nombre débarquent perdus et épuisés, s’accrochant désespérément à quelques possessions matérielles. Certains sont impatient de partir à la découverte de leur nouveau pays, tandis que d’autres se montrent plus circonspects quant à ce nouveau monde et à la vie qui les y attend. Des membres bienveillants de groups religieux et sociaux, des bénévoles et des fonctionnaires viennent apporter à ces nouveaux arrivants un appui spirituel, matériel et moral. En quelques heures, la majorité d’entre eux partent en train vers de nouveaux horizons un peu partout au Canada.  

Ce ne sont pas tous les immigrants qui ont été accueillis. Certains n’ont jamais franchi le quai 21. Ils se sont vu refuser l’entrée au pays pour des raisons médicales ou ethniques et ont été déportés. Même parmi ceux qui ont été acceptés, certains ont souffert de la discrimination et de la haine. Malgré tout, ils ont persévéré, survécu et réussi.

The Smoky Hill Trail was the most direct route to Denver and the goldfields of the central Rockies. Immigrants heading west through central Kansas followed the Kansas River, then headed up its Smoky Hill River branch into the high plains of eastern Colorado. Here, the Smoky Hill River ended. Immigrants then turned northwest to Denver over the high, dry rolling prairie country. It was a tough stretch. A Denver newspaper called those who dared it ""foolhardy and insane.""

Still, the Butterfield Overland Stage served the route, and later the Kansas Pacific Railroad built along the trail's ruts.

In 1844, Castro laid out a townsite, which the settlers chose to name Castroville. It became the center of Alsatian culture in Texas. The houses, European in style, are primarily single-story dwellings of cut limestone, mortared with adobe, and white-washed.

Many of these early residents worked in the growing railroad industry or at the Saint Paul Foundry, which operated through the 1980s. Minnesota's first locomotive run occurred on the rail tracks that served as the neighborhood's northern border in 1862.  
The origins of the Frogtown name are difficult to pin down, but likely came from the prevalence of frogs in what was originally a swampy, sparsely populated section of St. Paul. In fact, many of the early homes built in the neighborhood began to sink into the muck. Early German residents called the area Froschburg - literally frog city.  
Frogtown has long served as a welcoming community for immigrants and remains among the most diverse neighborhoods in St. Paul. German, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants were among the neighborhood's first residents. More recently, Frogtown has been influenced by residents of Hmong, Latino and Somali descent.  
Community support helped revitalize the University Avenue and Dale Street intersection and led to the completion of Frogtown Square, a mixed-use building home to small businesses and senior housing. The community is now rallying around plans to create Frogtown Park and Farm, where recreation, nature and urban farming will come together.  
This mix of history, culture and cooperation defines Frogtown and will continue to shape its development in the decades to come.

-60.749404,46.097346,History of Baddeck,"On Water Street, Baddeck, (On the right when traveling north)","English:   Derived from the Mi’kmaq name, ‘Abadak’, meaning “place with island near”, Baddeck’s first European settler was British officier James Duffus in 1819. He made his home on the “island near” and it was known as Duffus Island. An enterprising man, Duffus operated a general store here, servicing the Scottish immigrants and Loyalist in the area until his death twenty years later. When Duffus’s widow married William Kidston he assumed title to her property including the island and it was renamed, Kidston Island.   
For many years there were only two families living in Baddeck - the Campbells and the MacLeans. By 1881 with more than 1800 residents and surrounded by prosperous farming communities, Baddeck was a bustling, modern town with planked sidewalks, hotels, a post office, shops, a newspaper, a thriving shipbuilding industry, and a telegraph service.   
Two of Baddeck’s most famous residents included J.A.D. McCurdy who manned the first Canadian flight above Baddeck Bay in the Silver Dart in 1909 and world-renowned inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell. Today Baddeck is a quaint and popular resort town, loved for its beautiful scenery and spirited sailing community.
  
French:  
Tirant son nom de mot mi’kmaq «Abadak» - ce qui signifie «un endroit tout près d’une île», Baddeck a accueilli son premier colon européen en 1819, l’officier britannique James Diffus. Il s’établit à l’«île tout près» qui fut baptisée l’île Duffus. Homme entreprenant, Duffus a exploité un magasin général ici, desservant les immigrants écossais et les loyalistes de la région jusqu’a son décès vingt ans plus tard. Quand la veuve de Diffus a éspousé William Kidston, ce dernier devint propriétaire de ses biens, y compris de l’île qui fut renommée l’île Kidston.   

Pendant des années, il n’y avait que deux familles à Baddeck: les Campbell et les MacLeans. En 1881, comptant plus de 1800 résidants et entourée de collectivités agricole prospères, Baddeck était en pleine effervescence, ville moderne munie de trottoirs de bois, d’hotels, d’un bureau de poste, de boutiques, d’un journal, d’une industrie de la construction navale florissante, ainsi que d’un service de télégraphie.   

Deux des plus célèbres habitants de Baddeck sont J.A.D. McCurdy, qui a piloté le premier vol canadien au-dessus de la baie de Baddeck a bord du Silver Dart en 1909, et l’inventor du téléphone de reputation mondiale, Alexander Graham Bell.

Jean Nicolet was among the first Europeans to arrive in
Wisconsin, landing on the eastern shore of Green Bay near Red Banks in 1634. He was followed by Claude Allouez in 1639 and Father Louis Hennepin in 1675. 
   
For the next 200 years, American Indian groups including the Ho-Chunk, Menominee, and Potawatomi shared the regions resources with Euroamerican explorers and settlers. 
   
Early Settlers  
Door County’s first community was settled by Increase and Mary Ann Claflin in 1835. Claflin came form New York via Ohio and New Orleans finally settling first in Kaukauna and then in Little Sturgeon Bay. Many later immigrants settled along Bay Settlement Road (now WIS 57). Conflicts increased between Euroamericans and Indians due to differing lifestyles and increased demand for farmland. Ultimately, most Native Americans were removed from the
Door Peninsula by the mid-1800s according to the terms of treaties signed by tribes and the U.S. government. 
   
The Belgians  
Immigrants from Belgium began to settle the Door Peninsula and cleared land for farming in the 1850s. The disastrous 1871 wild fire that burned Peshtigo also burned much of the Door Peninsula. After the fire, Belgian settlers built distinctive red brick houses and roadside chapels. Many Belgian families supplemented farming income by manufacturing handmade wooden shingles. 
   
Following the Civil War, many of the established Belgian settlements grew into large towns and WIS 57 provided the transportation infrastructure necessary to connect these settlements. Today, some 20 percent of Door County residents can claim Belgian ancestry. 
   
The area around the town of Namur strongly reflects the
ethnic Belgian presence on the Door Peninsula and the
continuing residence by Belgian-American families. The
Namur-Brussels area has been designated a National
Historic Landmark District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cricket and Hays City dance halls delighted one colony, homestead rights and the steppe-like prairie the other. Victoria, established 1873, was named for a queen and laid out by a London architect. Herzog, just north, established 1876, was built of sod and named for a Volga village. By 1880, most of the aristocrats had moved on, and Herzog took over Victoria. Achievements here were: introduction of Aberdeen Angus cattle to the U.S. by Grant; pioneer crops of hard winter wheat by the immigrants.

Verlaque was a friend of Bernard Etcheverry, a French Basque immigrant, who by 1880 owned 16,700 acres of the original Santa Maria Rancho land grant and had a thriving rancho. Verlaque and Etcheverry decided that a store and post office could be a successful venture. Verlaque's son Amos purchased two acres from Etcheverry along the stage and freight wagon road connecting San Diego and Julian. The younger Verlaque built a store and post office (1883) and the town of Nuevo (later Ramon) was born.   
Verlaque decided to build a country home reminiscent of the homes of his youth in southern France and his many years spent living near the French community of St. Genevieve, Missouri. He had the home erected next to his son Amos' merchantile.   
The Verlaque House is a rare example of traditional French Provincial architecture in the Western United States. The home is built on a 2 foot thich fieldstone foundation with 18 inch adobe walls, has a 45 degree truncated hip roof, an elevated veranda surrounding the house and a basement wine celler with 7ft. ceilings and a ramp for wine barrels.    

This home was continuously owned by Verlaque descendents up until 1962 when it was purchased by Leona Ransom who wanted the home restored and preserved as a museum.

Built between 1826 and 1832, the Rideau Canal is the best preserved, fully operational example of North America’s great canal building era. Lieutenant-Colonel John By’s innovative deign was based on a “slackwater” system that linked lakes and rivers on a scale unprecedented in North America. The result was one of the first canals in the world engineered for steam-powered vessels. Its construction through more than 200 kilometres of bush, swamps, and lakes was a monumental feat. Each year, as many as 5,000 workers, mainly Irish immigrants and French Canadians, toiled under the supervision of civil contractors and the Royal Engineers. Working in extremely difficult conditions, they endured injury and disease, and hundreds died. This fortified waterway was intended as a safe military supply route between Montréal and Lake Ontario by providing an alternative to the St. Lawrence River. It chiefly served as a key artery for moving goods and people until the 1850s and became a popular recreational destination in the 20th century. The Rideau Canal was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2007.

German-speaking families, who had emigrated from the Alsace-Lorraine region on the border of Germany and France, populated this area of northwest Amherst known as the ""French Settlement."" These settlers traveled the Erie Canal to their new homes in rural Amherst, where farmland was plentiful.   The Sweet Home School was built in 1847 and used as a one-room school for grades 1-8 until 1948. It retains many of its major elements and is essentially a farm-type building, constructed by farmers rather than carpenters. Families served by the Sweet Home School cared for the building well throughout its use, and it survived basically intact, an accurate reflection of a typical rural school before the Civil War.   The Sweet Home School was built at a cost of $125 on land purchased for $20, all funds raised by the voters living in what was known as Sweet Home District #15.   As with any immigrant community, construction of a school was a top priority.   The school is a one-story wooden structure with a plank exterior covered in clapboarding. It has a wood-shingled roof, pine board ceiling, board flooring and walls of lath covered with plaster. Shelving was constructed around the room for use as a desk surface for pupils, and corresponding benches provided seating. A closet on the rear wall held classroom supplies. The school was heated by a wood stove.   The faded and nicked ""Prussian Blue"" interior paint remains as it was over 100 years ago, a typical color and condition for a mid-19th-century school.   All furnishings are reproductions, except for the original ""sandbox"" where children learned to make letters of the alphabet with a stylus in sand. Paper was a luxury in a mid-19th-century farming community, and from the sandbox, young writers would go on to use a slate.   The teacher utilized a raised wooden platform in the front of the room. In 1847, the first teacher, Mathias Fuller, was paid $14 a month. Teachers usually boarded with a local farm family. The two small rooms on either side of the door are separate cloakrooms for girls and boys.   In the early 19th century, the common or rural school was primarily under local control and served as the community's center of learning, teaching the traditional 3 R's to its children. Four common school districts would eventually consolidate to become what is now known as the Sweet Home Central School District.   Sweet Home Common School #15 is a good example of rural vernacular architecture, representing the center of everyday life in an immigrant community, as well as 100 years of history in the Sweet Home School District.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=83450,Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village; marker sponsor: Amherst Women's Interclub Council,,Education,"This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

-79.98648333,40.45838333,St. Nicholas Church,"Near Walkway to St. Nicholas Church Historic Site, Pittsburgh, ","In the late nineteenth century, Croatian immigrants fled economic hardship and settled in Allegheny City (now Pittsburgh's North Side). The Croatian immigrants were predominantly peasants living in a region comprised of one faith, one nationality, and one language. Community leaders were concerned their people were in danger of neglecting church obligations as a result of a failure to adjust to new customs and petitioned the diocese to establish the first Croatian parish in the New World in 1894. The church council dedicated the parish to St. Nicholas, the Traveler, in honor of its immigrant roots. Church services were first held in a converted house at 1546 E. Ohio Street. With immigration continuing, it was soon evident that a larger church was needed, and in 1899 plans were made for the construction of a permanent and grander edifice. 
 
Many Croatian families contributed physically and financially to the construction of St. Nicholas Church, whose splendor earned it the nickname ""Croatian Cathedral."" The building contract was awarded to Robert McCain, who submitted a bid of $19,000. In September 1901, Bishop Richard Phelan dedicated the new St. Nicholas Church, designed in a Romanesque-influenced style by Pittsburgh architect, Frederick C. Sauer. Two towers of unequal height, surmounted by onion-shaped domes, stood at either side of the western façade and contained three bells. A third steeple, erected at the rear of the church, served to give the building a secondary façade on its E. Ohio Street (south) elevation and distinguished St. Nicholas from other area churches. The floorplan of the church was longitudinal, containing a central nave with colonnaded aisles on either side and an apse at its east end. 
 
Shortly after the church was erected, a rectory was built opposite the church's west entrance to accommodate the Croatian Franciscan Order of priests. With the arrival of the automobile age, E. Ohio Street was widened from two to four lanes in 1921, requiring the church to be moved 20 feet north from its original foundation and eight feet up. The parish converted the adjacent Duquesne public school to St. Nicholas grammar school in 1931. In honor of Our Lady of Lourdes, an elaborate grotto was erected in 1944 on the hillside between the church and rectory. In 1950, a convent was built to house the sisters of the Franciscan Order who taught in St. Nicholas School until its closure in 1969. 
 
In 1994, St. Nicholas Parish celebrated its centennial. The E. Ohio Street church was permanently closed on the Feast of St. Nicholas, December 6, 2004. For 14 years, the Preserve Croatian Heritage Foundation and Preservation Pittsburgh worked diligently to save this magnificent, historic church.

The area was initially settled by German and Swiss immigrants who established tanning, lumber, brewing, and metals production concerns. Industrial and residential growth flourished between 1840 and 1880, aided by several transportation improvements: the Pennsylvania Canal (1829); Pittsburgh and Butler Plank Road (1849; later part of E. Ohio Street and State Route 28), the Western Pennsylvania Railroad (built on top of the canal after it closed in 1864); and the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad (1873). 
 
Croatians began settling in the North Side in 1882 in response to governmental changes that deprived them of political power, agricultural markets and land ownership. In Croatia, most of the immigrants had worked as agricultural laborers in a region knonwns for its grape production. In America, the immigrants worked long hours at industrial jobs. By 1900, food production, animal by-products, railroad, and steel industries became the dominant employers in the area, resulting in a demand for unskilled laborers that attracted a large number of immigrants. An 1873 federal law required animals to be removed from box cars, fed, and rested after 28 hours of confinement, and Herr's Island was a convenient feed and rest-stop between Chicago and eastern markets. The Pennsylvania Railroad operated stock yards at Herr's Island between 1903 and 1965, providing a range of livestock-related jobs to the neighborhood. 
 
Unlike the earlier German settlers, the immigrants typically lived in rented quarters, either in subdivided homes or in boarding houses in which a dozen or more single men would live. The nearby Sarah Heinz House aided the Croatian community in its transaction to American life by providing boys and girls with educational and recreational facilities. 
 
Mala Jaska's Croatian population was distinguished by its political activism, and such sentiments were expressed through a number of organizations and newspapers. The Croatian newspaper, Danica, and the Croatian Fraternal Union of America were begun in 1894 by Zdravko Mužina, Josip Marohnić operated America's first Croatian bookstore at 1420 E. Ohio Street and published the first Croatian-English dictionary for fellow immigrants. 
 
Withing a generation, many residents of Mala Jaska owned their own homes. Bound together by a common faith and language, a tight knit and independent community developed along this narrow stretch of E. Ohio Street. The area's topography gave it a unique character: houses on the northwest side of the street were banked into the hillside, allowing the use of masonry vaults for cold storage; on the southeast side of the street, houses only two-rooms deep were squeezed between the street and railroad, allowing trains to pass within a few feet of the rear windows. The steep hillsides were terraced for growing fruits and vegetables, which were shared among neighbors. Residents took great pride in their community and beautified their yards with terraced flower gardens. 
 
The neighborhood's greatest asset, its proximity to numerous modes of transportation, ultimately became the source of its demise. In 1921, E. Ohio Street was expanded from two to four lanes, resulting in the removal of all buildings on the southeast side of the street and the demolition or alteration of numerous building on the northwest side of the street. Further decline occurred in 2014 with the completion of the State Route 28 safety and improvement project, which razed the neighborhood's remaining buildings on the northwest side of the street.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=84561,,,"Fraternal or Sororal Organizations,Labor Unions,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

There is no clearer picture of America's growing economy: the Erie Canal expanded these new settlements with unprecedented speed. Large-scale farming and factories followed the pioneers, and cities were rising out of the wild.   The green map shows the Erie Canal at the heart of a complex network of trade and settlement stretching from New York Harbor, across the Great Lakes, to the Rocky Mountains. A complete system of railroads, highways, and other infrastructures would soon follow, providing access to the country's vast resources. The United States were finally united.   The Western Cities. When guest speaker DeWitt Clinton turned the first spade of dirt for the construction of Cleveland's Ohio and Erie Canal in 1825, he predicted great days ahead for this muddy port at the mouth of the silted-up Cuyahoga River, pronouncing that Cleveland would gain access ""...not only to the markets of New Orleans, but of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Montreal."" This was no exaggeration, and by the time the Ohio Canal was completed in 1833, the population already approached five thousand.   Less than twenty years later, it was more than forty thousand. Like Buffalo, Cleveland and other port cities on the Great Lakes - Detroit, Duluth, Chicago - would experience profound economic growth as America's huge supply of natural resources and manufactured goods found their way around the world.   The Pineries. Early 19th century America was a wilderness, with vast pine forests stretching from New England to Western Canada. Pine was the ideal wood to house America's growing population. It floated, it was light, straight-grained and easy to work, and large tracts were accessible by water for shipping around the Great Lakes or down the Mississippi. When the Erie Canal opened in 1825, it started a timber revolution. Shipping costs and distances for lumber were drastically reduced, initiating new construction on a grand scale. In addition to pine, different hardwoods were also brought to Western New York and were the basis of an important furniture manufacturing industry that remains to this day.   The World's Breadbasket. The Erie Canal opened up the large-scale agriculture of the Midwest not only to America, but to Eurpoe and the rest of the world. The timing was perfect. The large-scale conversion to industrial labor and manufacturing in Eurpoe, along with a general exodus of agricultural workers to cities, was creating profound food shortages. Entire farming communities were being abandoned, and their fields lay fallow. The new factory classes needed food, lots of it, and the Erie Canal allowed the Midwest's limitless stores of grain to supply Europe's inexhaustible appetite.   Buffalo's Canal District, Gateway to the Interior of North America. Coopers blacksmiths, sailmakers, saddlers, glassblowers, baskertmakers, telegraphers, cobblers, and forwarders were all working in the canal district.   This facade is reminiscent of warehouses that once lined the Commercial Slip. As the Erie Canal's terminus, Buffalo was the distribution point for much of the nation's goods. Boats were loaded and unloaded, and the neighborhood hummed day and night. There was work for thousands of laborers and craftsmen, and the city became famous for its breweries and distilleries. There were 500 taverns and gaming houses by 1850, and the abundance of ale often made for trouble (the January 7, 1856 Buffalo Daily Courier reported ""2,243 arrests for last year, 1,792 of which...are chargeable to drunkenness and disorderly conduct."")   A City, and a Nation, Grow Up. Scorned by DeWitt Clinton in 1810 as a village with ""...five lawyers and no church"", Buffalo rose to match the prodigious economic growth generaed by the Erie Canal. Ballooning from 2,600 residents in 1824 to more than 40,000 in 1850, Buffalo became a fine city of promenades and shops. Other urban centers would rise along the banks of the canal just as rapidly.   The Erie Canal has shifted America's economic axis from north-south to east-west, and made New York City the nation's major port, surpassing Baltimore, Boston and New Orleans in shipping volume. And as the flood of New Englanders and European immigrants moved west, momentum shifted from the slaveholding, plantation economy of the South to the developing agricultural and manufacturing industries of the North. It was the great Westward flow, and it all passed through Buffalo.   Lockport: The Flight of Five. While the Erie Canal is ranked among the greatest engineering achievements of the 19th century, amny consider the schievement at Lockport to be the jewel of the enterprise. The five-tiered eastbound and westbound locks, cut directly into the hard stone of the Niagara Escarpment, carried canal traffic over the 60-foot rise in elevation. It was one of the sights of the age, and a city sprang up around the locks, which, although reconfigured, remain in operation to this day.   ...Yearning to Breathe Free. Long before Ellis Island existed, Buffalo was one of America's major ports of immigration. Buffalo, as the western terminus of the Erie Canal, was often the last civilized town that immigrants would encounter before departing on the lake boats towards the largely unmapped West. On the years before abolition, thousands of escaped slaves passed though the city, following the Underground Railroad north to Canada and freedom. And Buffalo and Niagara Falls were ports of entry in their own right, with thousands of legal (and illegal) immigrants arriving from Canada, Europe and Asia through what immigration officials called ""the back door.""   The immigrant's journey along the Erie Canal was cramped and slow, but it was also an eye-opener. They were witnessing the creation of a young country. Men and Women who, only a few years before, had been penniless immigrants themselves were working the land, starting businesses, and building factories along the banks of the canal.   Canawlers. The business of moving goods and people along the canal involved thousands of boats and their crews. In 1845, there were 4,000 boats on the canal, operated by 25,000 men, women, and children. A typical crew included a captain, a steersman, a cook, a deckhand, and hoggees, who drove the teams that pulled the canal boats.   In addition, thousands were employed to maintain and operate the canal itself, including lock tenders, toll collectors, bridge operators, surveyors, repair crews, and even bank patrolers, whose job, called the bankwatch, required a man to patrol a ten-mile stretch of canal looking for leaks and breaks in the canal bank.

Millers had long used the Upper Falls of the Genesee River to grind their grain into a high-quality flour known throughout the region, and a small village had grown up around the falls. But when the Erie Canal opened, Rochester became a boomtown.   The first ten days the canal was in operation, 40,000 barrels (3,600 tons) of flour were shipped to the markerts in New York City. Millers were soon grinding 25,000 bushels of wheat every day. Construction was constant, and by the Mid-1830s, Rochester's population was more than 14,000, with some twenty flour mills operating day and night.   BY the 1850s, however, much of the country's grain production has moved to the Great Plains, and Rochester's importance as a milling center was declining. But seeds of change were already planted. William A. Reynolds had started a small nursery and seed business in 1830; by 1850, it has become the Ellwanger &amp; Barry Nursery Co., one of a network of Rochester seed companies that would become the largest and most famous in the world.   Rome, New York, 1817. At sunrise on July 4th, 1817, along a plain stretch of grass and trees just outside the village of Rome, a large curious crowd had gathered. All eyes were on Judge John Richardson, the canal's first signed contractor, stationed behind his team of oxen, resting his hand on his plow. Canal Commissioner Samuel Young stood and made a speech, proclaiming ""By this great highway, unborn millions will...hold a useful and profitable intercourse with all the maritime nations of the earth.""   The cannon at the nearby Rome arsenal boomed, and Jude Richardson drove his oxen forward, inaugurating the construction of the Erie Canal. Rome, a town with an empire's name, has seen the beginning of a project that would make New York into the Empire State, and New York City into one of the greatest ports in the world.   Information Superhighway. The Erie Canal's impact spread far beyond its role in developing America's young economy, acting as a conduit of culture, civic life, and national identity for almost a century.   The canal linked together communities that, without it, would have been isolated and underserved. It wasn;t just a highway of industry: news spread along its course like an electrical surge. Along with its cargos of timber and coal, the Erie Canal carried the latest fashions, advances in education and manufacturing, and heaps of country gossip.   Much has been made of the civilizing effect of inventions like the telegraph, the telephone, and the internet on society. These innovations strengthen communities, increase individual productivity, and improve quality of life and convenience. Loking at it this way, the Erie Canal could be called America's first great communications network.   A Family Affair. A typical canal boat, pulled by two horses or mules, weighs nearly fifty tons, is seventy-seven feet long by fourteen feet three inches wide, and moves through the water at a steady, lazy clip of four miles an hour or so. It is also a fully functioning mobile home. The boat captain and his family spend the majority of their lives onboard.   The smallest child sits tied to the deck so she won't fall into the water, while the oldest acts as steersman, guiding the boat along, always compensating for the sideward pull of the tow-rope upon the vessel.   The sons drive the horse or mule teams, guiding the tired beasts onto the onboard stable to 'change shifts', leading a fresh team out onto the towpath. They feed and groom the animals, and call out ""Low Bridge!"" at the frequent overhead crossings.   Mother and daughter are busy throughout the day, haning the washing out on lines running across the stern, meeting purveyors by the waterside, darning socks and linens, and preparing meals in the family's close, cramped quarters.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=84908,,,"Abolition & Underground RR,Communications,Industry & Commerce,Waterways & Vessels","This page was last revised on June 16, 2016.

In danger of retribution, 2,500 Mexican civilians, including 527 Chinese, accompanied Pershing when he returned to the U.S. in February 1917.

 Irish Roots in Old Québec / La présence irlandaise dans le Vieux-Québec    
English:  
 The Story in Brief    

History notes that the first Irish in Quebec City were soldiers in the French army and, later, soldiers and officers of the British garrison. By 1815, the newcomers were mostly Protestant business people and craftsmen. Around I830, Irish immigrants were mainly Catholic and of more modest means. Massive emigration from Ireland, which was plagued by famine and disease, was a phenomenon of the 1840s. By 1871, some 12,500 Québec City citizens were
of Irish origin.   

Today, millions of North Americans of Irish descent view Quebec City and Grosse-Île as sacred to the memory of the 19th Century Irish diaspora in North America.   

 Irish Institutions Take Root    


Back in 1760, Protestant Irish immigrants joined the various institutions of the British community
in Quebec City. In 1859, they set up their own Irish Protestant Benevolent Society. Commemorative plaques can be seen in many Anglophone institutions honouring the contribution of these sons of Ireland.  
 
Around 1830, the burgeoning Irish Catholic community created a network of religious, social, and cultural institutions which, for the most part, are still in existence today.   

The cornerstone of the first St. Patrick’s Church ② on rue Sainte-Helene (now McMahon) was hastily laid in 1832 during a cholera epidemic. The presbytery ③ on rue Saint~Stanislas was a
few steps from the residence ④ of Father Patrick McMahon, the first pastor and thus founder of what many consider the first national Irish church in Canada.   

The elderly and the orphans, quite numerous in the 19th, were housed in rented premises on rue Saint-Stanislas ⑤. Founded by Anna Bradley and a group of lay women, Saint Brigid‘s Home moved to a new site on Grande-Allée in 1858. In 1884. an imposing, new school ⑥ was built across from the church to replace the earlier school on rue des Glacis ⑦.   

St. Patrick‘s Day was celebrated for the first time in Québec City on March 17, 1765, by the Protestant Irish officers of the British garrison. Later, and for more than a century, St. Patrick‘s Literary Institute ⑧ organized the events surrounding the celebration, including masses, parades, banquets, and stage shows.   

Today, St. Patrick's Day has become increasingly at festive occasion for Quebec City citizens of all origins, living testimony to a shared heritage.    

French: 

 Une histoire à découvrir    

Les premiers Irlandais à s'établir à Québec sont des soldats de l'armée française et, ensuite, des soldats et officiers de l'armée britannique. Vers 1815, les Irlandais qui débarquent sont généralement protestants: gens d'affaires et de métier. Après 1830, ils sont de statut social modeste et majoritairement catholiques. L'émigration massive d'Irlande, marquée par la famine et les épidémies, date des années I840. En I871 , la ville compte 12 500 citoyens d'origine irlandaise.   
Aujourd'hui, des millions de Nord-Américains de souche irlandaise considèrent Québec et Grosse-Île comme des hauts lieux de la diaspora irlandaise du l 9ᵉ siècle en Amérique.    


 Des institutions bien enracinées    

Dès 1760, les immigrants irlandais protestants s'intègrent aux institutions de la communauté
britannique de la capitale. Néanmoins ils créent, en I859, la  Irish Protestant Benevolent Society pour soutenir leurs propres œuvres. On voit des plaques témoignant de la contribution de ces ﬁls d‘Irlande dans plusieurs institutions anglophones
de la ville de Québec.    

De son côté, la communauté irlandaise catholique naissante se dote, à partir de 1830, d'un ensemble d'institutions qui, pour l'essentiel, poursuivent leur œuvre aujourd'hui.   

La pierre angulaire de la première église catholique St. Patrick ②, rue Sainte-Hélène (aujourd'hui McMahon), est posée en 1832 durant une épidémie de choléra. Le presbytère ③, rue Saint-Stanislas, est à deux pas de la résidence ④ de l'abbe’ Patrick
McMahon, pasteur fondateur de ce qui est parfois considéré comme la première paroisse nationale irlandaise au Canada.    

Les personnes âgées et les orphelins, nombreux au 19ᵉ siècle, sont logés dans une maison louée, rue Saint-Stanislas ⑤. Cet asile est l'oeuvre de Mme Anna Bradley et des dames de la paroisse. Le foyer Saint Brigid's Home est déménagé sur la Grand Allée en I858. En I884, une imposante école ⑥, construite de biais par rapporta à église, remplace celle de la rue des Glacis ⑦. La Saint-Patrick est fêtée pour la première fois à Québec le l7 mars I765 par les officiers s irlandais protestants de la garnison britannique. Plus tard, et ce durant plus d'un siècle, le  St. Patrick's Literary Institute  ⑧ assure la fête nationale en organisant messes, déﬁlés, banquets et spectacles.   

Aujourd‘hui, la Saint-Patrick est de plus en plus une fête pour l'ensemble de la population de Québec. toutes origines confondues. File témoigne d'un héritage commun toujours vivant.

 The Irish Settle and Flourish / Les Irlandais s'installent et laissent leur marque    
English:  
 ""Little Irelands""    

Because of the many marriages between Irish immigrants and Francophones, many experts believe that some 40% of Québecers have an ancestor of Irish descent. As can be seen on the map of the area around Quebec City, immigrants from Ireland settled widely and gave Irish names to numerous towns and villages, including Armagh, Coleraine, Saint-Adrien, Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval, Saint-Patrice-de-Beauriyage, Shannon, and Saint-Malachie.   


On the Waterfront and Beyond   


In I9th Century Quebec City, economic activity centred on shipbuilding, and the lumber trade. Irish Protestants were involved in shipbuilding, as were many French Canadians. The newly arrived Irish Catholics gravitated towards the more dangerous work on the docks. In 1862, they created the Québec Ship Labourers Benevolent Society, considered to be the most powerful union in Canada in the 19th Century. Irish women were particularly active in service trades such as rooming houses, millinery, teaching, and domestic service. In due course, the local economy and professions included many Irish families such as: the Boswells, Breakeys, Burns, Caldwells, Delaneys, Dinans, Dinnings, Leonards, Maddens, Maguires, MacDonalds, McKennas, McInenlys, Nesbitts, Nielsons, Noonans, O’Farrells, Olivers, Parkes, Pembertons, Quinns, Timmonys, and Welchs.   


 
The Irish in Public Life   


Many well-known Irishmen were involved in the Patriots Movement or participated in other political reforms of the 19th Century. Among them: Cannon, Lester, McGreevy, O'Callaglan, Ryan, and Shehyn. Two Irishmen, Charles Alleyn and Owen Murphy, were elected Mayor of Quebec City in 1854 and 1874 respectively. Since 1867, Irish Quebecers from the city and surrounding area have been prominent in the judiciary and parliament, including Cannon, Carbray, Dawson, Delisle, Fitzpatrick, Flynn, Kaine, Mackasey, Mulroney, O’Gallagher, O’Neill, Power, Ross, and Saint-Laurent. A few became Prime Minister or ministers of the Crown. Some Irish families have provided candidates for political oﬁice in Québec City and Ottawa generation alter generation to this very day.   


French: 
Des Irlandais font souche au Québec   


Selon plusieurs spécialistes, 40 % des Québécois ont un ancêtre de souche irlandaise. Les traces de l'immigration irlandaise sont évidentes, notamment dans la toponymie québécoise: Armagh, Colleraient, Saint-Adrien-d'Irlande, Sainte Brigitte-de-Laval, Saint-Patrice-de-Beaurivage, Shannon, Saint-Malachie.    

Gagner sa vie à Québec au 19ᵉ siècle   


Au l9ᵉ siècle, l'activité économique á Québec tourne autour de la construction navale et de
l'exportation du bois. De nombreux Irlandais protestants travaillent á la construction des navires tout comme bon nombre de Canadiens français. Les Irlandais catholiques, fraîchement débarqués, trouvent d’abord un emploi comme débardeur. En 1862, ils fondent la  Québec Ship Labourers Benevolent Society,  considérée comme le plus puissant syndicat au Canada au 19ᵉ siècle. Les femmes irlandaises sont particulièrement actives dans les entreprises de services, entre autres comme tenancières de maisons de pension, modistes, enseignantes et domestiques.  Avec le temps, les familles irlandaises rejoignent tous les secteurs de l'économie. Certaines d’entre elles se nomment Boswell, Breakey, Burns, Caldwell, Delaney, Dinan, Dinning, Leonard, Madden, Maguire, MacDonald, McKenna, McInenly, Nesbitt, Nielson, Noonan, O’Farrell, Oliver, Parke, Pemberton, Quinn, Timmony et Welch.    

Des citoyens actifs

Plusieurs personnalités irlandaises militent dans le mouvement des Patriotes et sont associées aux réformes politiques du 19ᵉ siècle dont Cannon, Lester, McGreevy,O'Callaghan, Ryan et Shehyn. Deux Irlandais sont élus à la mairie de Québec: Charles Alleyn en 1854 et Owen Murphy en 1874. Après 1867, des descendants des Irlandais de la région accèdent à la magistrature ou sont député, ministre ou premier ministre à Assemblée législative du Québec ou à la Chambre des Communes à Ottawa: Cannon, Carbray, Dawson, Delisle, Fitzpatrick, Flynn, Mackasey, Mulroney, O’Gallagher, O'Neill, Power, Ross et Saint-Laurent.

Now, the western territory was open and available, and whoever settled Kansas first would determine its status as a free or slave state. A new frenzied wave of migration began. City of Kansas residents were acutely affected. Missouri was a slave state and most residents held a pro-South bias.  
 The addition of another free state on the Missouri border posed a threat. But the City of Kansas, with both its popular steamboat landing and its unsurpassed access to the new territory, held an economic advantage as this historic turn of events began to unfold. By 1880 the bluffs had been cut into the streets, the city ran several miles south of the river, the population was over 50,000, and the city was on its way to becoming a metropolis.

 Which Scene Do You See?  
 Despite the idyllic river scene on the left, hordes of people were rushed up the Missouri River during the contentious 1850s. They crowded the steamboat landing before passing through the city bluffs and scurrying to establish their physical presence and to influence which party – pro-slavery or abolitionist – would prevail. By 1855 the flood of immigrants dramatically swelled the population of the little City of Kansas. In a two-year period, 1855-1857, the Gilliss house Hotel reported 27,000 new arrivals.  
   “In front of the town the broad bouldered landing slopping down to the water’s edge presented a confusing picture of immense piles of freight, horse, ox, and mule teams receiving merchandise from the steamer, scores of immigrants wagons, and a busy crowd of whites, Indians, half-breeds… Carts and horses wallowed in the deep excavations; and the houses stood trembling on the verge as if in fear of tumbling down.

Irish stonecutters John W. Key and sons were hired for two years to construct the piers that uphold the bridge, and German immigrant engineer Albert Fink designed and built one of his patented trusses. In its day, this bridge was the largest iron bridge in the United States, at 1,075 feet long. 
 
The bridge’s true importance became evident in 1861, as the armies of the Union and Confederacy sought control of the vital rail lines. This railroad bridge was the link that could draw northern forces south. In an odd turn of fate, in August 1861 when General Simon Bolivar Buckner received instructions to destroy the bridge, the Keys, who had joined Buckner’s rebel force, were detailed to set and blow the charges, dropping two spans into the river to prevent the Union from using the bridge. 
 
Three battles and five years of continuous military occupation followed, all for defense of the bridge. But the war would end, and trains would continue, and the stone piers that bore witness to the conflict still support the bridge today.

The town prospered as a supplier of goods and services to pioneers heading west. European immigrants landed here by riverboat before starting their long trek to Utah, California, or Oregon with handcarts or wagons.

– Mathilda Gruen Wagner, daughter of German immigrants, 1860s 
 
In 1845, hundreds of hopeful German immigrants came to the Texas Hill Country in search of land, political freedom and adventure. Johann “Casper” Danz, his wife Elisabeth and their baby boy Frederick were among them. 
 
Tragedy struck the Danz family many times. Soon after they arrived in Fredericksburg, Elisabeth and her son died from an epidemic.	Casper’s second bridge, Johannette Margarethe Knaup-Flick, died during childbirth. 
 
In 1857, Danz married his third wife, Johanne Dorothea Bock. This time the family flourished with eleven children. In 1860, the couple purchased the land you stand on today. Their descendants lived here until 1966, when the land became a park. 
 
 
Danz Cabin - Take a short walk up this trail to see the earliest German cabin in the park. The Danz family built this two-room (dogtrot) home in 1860. It is the second cabin they built (“Cabin B” marks the spot of the first). One room of the cabin served as both a bedroom and living space, and the other was a kitchen. Fireplaces provided heat for warmth and cooking. Outdoor stairways leading to the sleeping lofts save much needed space indoors. 
 
Cabin B - This cabin was moved here from a nearby community in 1974 to provide space for living history demonstrations and storage. This building sits atop a stone cellar that is believed to be the foundation of the Danz’ first cabin. 
 
Corral - Reconstructed of stacked split cedar posts. 
 
Well - About 30 feet deep and lined with hand-laid limestone. 
 
 
The Danz cabin is the oldest example of a German Hill Country home in the park.

By the time Bridget purchased this double house in 1879 for $300, John had been killed in a local mining accident. She was living on one side raising two children while renting the other side to another Irish “widow of the mines” with six children.

After the Shawnee were removed from what would become Auglaize County, James Knox Lytle, cousin to James Knox Polk, purchased land in Washington Township. Lytle platted a village of 102 lots in 1836, calling it Knoxville to honor his mother's family. Meanwhile, newly married Wilhelm and Elisabeth Fledderjohann Kuckhermann (later Kuck) immigrated from Ladbergen in northwest Germany. Having missed their boat to St. Louis, the couple lived briefly in Stallostown (Minster) and Bremen (New Bremen). They wrote home, encouraging others to emigrate; in the summer of 1835 the Fledderjohanns (Elisabeth's family), Meckstroth's, and Lutterbecks arrived. The families bought land near the site of Knoxville.  Side 2 Establishment of the village coincided with the earliest wave of German immigration to the United States. The former Ladbergers' reports from Ohio prompted an exodus to America, especially among those with limited economic opportunities. In many cases, immigrants arranged for their relatives and friends to follow them, creating a chain migration. Until 1850, all the settlers in Knoxville (renamed New Knoxville in 1858) were from Ladbergen. Later, others from northwest Germany joined Ladbergers in settling here. The immigrants' shared culture included agricultural and architectural traditions, Protestant piety, and language - Platt Deutsch (Low German). For more than a century New Knoxville residents were trilingual, using Platt, High german, or English at home, school, church, and in their rural lives.

In this situation many agricultural immigrants chose to migrate to other countries in South America or to return to their country of origin. Immigrants working in fisheries, lacking adequate resources for the development of this activity, returned to Japan. However, the families mentioned here, with their strong pioneering spirit and the pride and dignity of being Japanese, overcame great adversity and remained in the Dominican Republic.

But few of their plans have been built.  In 1873 businessman and city commissioner Thomas P. Morgan (whose name survives as part of Adams-Morgan) created Oak Lawn, a four-story, Second Empire mansion, where the upper edge of the Washington Hilton sits today. Oak Lawn honored the property's 400-year-old ""Treaty Oak,"" said to be the site of treaty negotiations between English settlers and Native Americans. Over time the property appealed to George Washington University, the Grand Lodge of Masons, and even controversial modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright. But the university and the Masons couldn't raise needed funds, and Wright's elaborate scheme for ""Crystal Heights"" - 21 glass towers with apartments, hotel rooms, theater, restaurants, stores, 1,500 parking spaces, and roof-top gardens cascading down the hill - was rejected by city officials.  Morgan's house remained until 1952, when it was razed. The Treaty Oak was thoughtlessly cut down a year later. Finally, in 1965 the Washington Hilton opened here. It became a noted Washington venue for conventions, inaugural balls, and political speeches.

-104.833109,41.157628,The Trails (Part I),"On Carey Avenue, Cheyenne, (On the left when traveling south)","Long before the railroad, airplane, and automobile; the desire to develop the West brought explores, mountain men, fur trappers and a few brave settlers into Wyoming. Later this would be followed by miners, farmers and ranchers, and hundreds of thousands of settlers to California, Oregon and Utah. Many of the routes that would eventually become prominent trails were developed by Native Americans as they followed the natural migration routes of Bison, Elk and other prairie animals as they moved from winter camps to spring and summer hunting grounds. In this semi-arid region water was a major consideration in trail selection, most major trails followed primary rivers. Another key factor in trail selection was the need to cross mountain ranges and rough terrain with loaded wagons, coaches or while driving cattle long distances.   
-The Settler Trails-   
Several major immigrant trails crossed Wyoming, which at different times included part of Nebraska, Idaho, Utah, Oregon, and the Dakota Territories before becoming the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868.  
The Oregon Trail - First used by Captain Benjamin Bonneville in 1832, the first official wagon train used it in 1841, and then the trail was in continuous use from 1843 until the arrival of the railroad. The route covered 2000 miles from Independence, Missouri to the Columbia River in Oregon. It followed the North Platte River across Nebraska to the Sweetwater River in central Wyoming, then crossed the Continental Divide at South Pass City before entering the Green River Basin, and into the Fort Bridger Valley before turning northwest toward Idaho and ultimately Oregon. At least two other famous trails would follow or parallel the Oregon Trail across Wyoming (Mormon Pioneer Trail and the Pony Express Trail).  
The California Trail - In use from 1841 to 1868, this trail was discovered by trappers and explorers and used to supply the mountain men rendezvous in the 1820's and 30's. The route departed from either Independence or St. Joseph, Missouri, and followed the North Platte River across Nebraska and two thirds of Wyoming before crossing over South Pass in the Wind River Range down through the Green River Basin and out to Utah and on to the goldfields of California. In addition to the immigrants; the trail was used to haul supplies, mail, and later people in stagecoaches.  
The Mormon Pioneer Trail - The Mormons (now referred to as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) left their homes in Nauvoo, Illinois starting in 1846/47 and by 1869, 70,000 people had moved to Utah to establish their new homes in the Great Salt Lake Valley. The Trail crossed the Missouri River at Omaha, Nebraska, moving west to join the Oregon Trail. Across Nebraska the Mormons would travel on the northside of the Platte River while other wagon trains would follow along the south side of the river. At Fort Bridger the trail would follow the California Trail through the Wasatch Mountains and into the valley.  
The Trapper's Trail - This informal trail across the front range of Colorado ultimately traversed from Taos, New Mexico, up into the Dakotas. Originally used by Native Americans, early explorers, and the mountain men it would later be used by north-south stage and freight lines diverting from the Santa Fe Trail across Colorado and into Wyoming. From 1820 to 1846 the main portion of the trail was from Bent's Fort in Colorado north 400 miles meeting the Oregon Trail at Fort Laramie. This trail passed through the area that would later be called Cheyenne.  
The Cherokee Trail - Although following part of the the Trapper's Trail, this trail was also known as the Arkansas Emigrant Trail until 1849 and 1850 when two large bands of Cherokee Indians used it to get to the goldfields of California. Following the Santa Fe Trail to Bent's Fort on the Arkansas River in Colorado, it turned north and followed the Trapper's Trail to about present-day Fort Collins where it turned northwest toward Laramie and on across southern Wyoming. Later this route would become the Overland Trail.  
The Bozeman Trail - Begun as a shortcut across central Wyoming to the Montana goldfields, it started at Fort Fetterman (near Douglas) on the Oregon Trail. Approximately 3,500 immigrants traversed the trail from 1863 to 1868. The trail required military posts to protect travelers and ultimately was one of the causes of the Indian Wars. It was abandoned in 1868 following the Fort Laramie Treaty but reopened in the 1876 military campaigns at Rosebud and Little Big Horn.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=95197,"City of Cheyenne, Cheyenne Historic Historic Preservation Board, Cheyenne Area Convention and Visitors Board, Wyoming Cultural Trust Fund and Preserve America",,"Roads & Vehicles,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on  June 17, 2016.

— to the Santa Fe Railroad for directing the Mennonite immigrants to a productive land and making it available under favorable terms,  
— to our government for respecting conscience, rewarding industry, and granting freedom for Christian outreach,  
— to our God for His leading and continued blessing.  
During the 1870's and the early 1880's about eight thousand Mennonites migrated from the Steppes of south Russia to America, and arrived near this spot in Peabody, Kansas. Because of their dedication to God and their faith in Jesus Christ, they sought a land where their desire for religious freedom would be honored.  
America became that land. The terms of the Santa Fe Railroad and those of the government for land purchases were attractive, and the vast, fertile plains and favorable climate made Kansas their choice. The record of the past one hundred years reveals that the Mennonites made a wise decision.  
Peabody and the neighboring communities became the port of entry for the Russian Mennonites to the Kansas rolling prairies. The Turkey Hard Red Winter Wheat became the origin of the hard winter wheat grown in America and has made Kansas the largest wheat producing state in the nation.  
Though an agricultural people, these immigrants also recognized the importance of providing for the spiritual, cultural, and physical needs of themselves and others. They plowed the sod but also established churches, schools, and hospitals.  
Distinctive to the Mennonite heritage are the principles of peace and compassion. The Mennonites believed that a disciple of Jesus Christ should heal the wounds of individuals and nations rather than inflict them. Churches and colleges have been instrumental in providing programs of outreach in missions and voluntary service. Through the years they have had many opportunities to extend a helping hand to suffering mankind around the world. They felt compelled by the love of God to help alleviate suffering, especially when natural disasters struck.

-87.91472222,43.04694444,Haymarket Square History,"On West McKinley Avenue, Milwaukee, (On the right when traveling west)","You wouldn't know it now, but this part of Milwaukee was one of the city's most populated neighborhoods in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A vast public market here drew people from all over town. Although the haymarket has faded away, its legacy remains as the cityscape continues to evolve. 

An Early Settlement in Old Milwaukee 

The Haymarket neighborhood mainly covers the blocks between Juneau Avenue on the south, Walnut Street on the north, 3rd Street on the east and 8th Street on the west. Most early settlers here in the 1830s and '40s were German immigrants. By about the 1880s, many of the residents were Jewish immigrants who had left Europe and Russia to escape persecution and poverty. However, the neighborhood population grew so rapidly, it gave way to overcrowded, impoverished living conditions.  

A group of primarily Jewish women volunteers, led by Lizzie Kander, worked to improve life in ""the Jewish ghetto"" as it was known in the late 1800s. They educated immigrants and their children in sewing, cooking, cleaning and English lessons at local synagogues. In 1901 they opened a house on 5th Street (near Galena St.) called The Settlement, where anyone could go to learn and practice those skills. Using favorite community recipes, they published The Settlement Cook Book in 1903, which became a staple in American kitchens through most of the 1900s.  

The Settlement House was an early predecessor to Milwaukee's Jewish Community Center, now located in Whitefish Bay.  

Evolution of a Public Market 

Around 1840, Milwaukee's founders designated this area as a public market. The ""Haymarket Square"" name later caught on as a place where farmers parked their horses and piles of hay they brought into town for dairies, breweries and tanneries. Grain and wood were also sold there. As automobiles appeared in the 1910s, produce and flowers filled the market, and the need for hay declined.  

The market continued through the 1950s, but the surrounding neighborhood had its share of difficulties as people who could afford to move migrated from city to suburbs. They often left behind vacant businesses, rundown homes and a fragmented community.  

By the 1960s, urban renewal gained momentum, though it was tough on neighborhoods already experiencing economic and social hardships. The city sued itself in a strange effort to overturn the founders' original deed which restricted the area to be used only as a public market. Eventually, many homes and other buildings were demolished to make way for industrial and business development. In 1968, you could still see a few old horse-drawn wagons left next to buildings in the Haymarket area.  

Increase Lapham: A Famous Resident 

Lapham Street, Lapham Peak in Delafield, Lapham Hall at UWM... all are named after Increase Lapham (yes, Increase was his first name). This remarkable Wisconsinite lived right here, just a few yards to the west on McKinley Avenue, which was called Poplar Street in his day.  

Increase Lapham arrived in Milwaukee in 1836 as a surveyor and is considered ""Wisconsin's first great scientist."" He diligently observed and recorded data about geology, biology, meteorology and other natural sciences. He made many of Milwaukee's early maps and the first published map of the state. His drawings and maps were used to develop railroads and canals. He catalogued the first description of all plants and shells in the Milwaukee area. He published studies about meteorites, Native American effigy mounds (some of which were located in this neighborhood), and damage reports from Lake Michigan storms - eventually prompting the creation of the U.S. Weather Service.  

Lapham warned officials about the danger of deforestation long before others understood it. A strong advocate for education, he founded the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and was a founder of the Milwaukee Female College. Lapham, along with Rufus King, was instrumental in developing Milwaukee's public libraries and education system.

Borderland  

The 1819 Adams-Oñis Treaty fixed the boundary between the U.S. and Spain at the Arkansas River, formalizing a centuries-old convention - the Arkansas had always been a border. Neighboring Indian tribes fronted tensely on this crucial waterway, whose wealth of resources (water, timber, pasture, game) were essential for survival. The colonial powers, too, jostled for control of the river, which came to represent the proverbial line in the sand. Any breach drew the fiercest resistance. Spain was particularly vigilant, ignoring French and American travelers north of the Arkansas but treating all who ventured south of it (including Zebulon Pike) as hostile invaders. With America's 1848 conquest of northern Mexico and the removal of the Arapahos and Cheyennes in 1865, the river finally ceased to divide. For the first time in perhaps 1,000 years, the Arkansas served a single country. Today, it remains a cultural border of the American Southwest.  

Crossroads of the Arkansas 

Pueblo sits at the intersection of two ancient thoroughfares - the Arkansas River, gateway to the mountains and a key prairie highway, and Fountain Creek, part of the long north-south road along the Front Range of the Rockies. Utes, Plains Apaches, Comanches, Kiowas, Arapahos, and Cheyennes all frequented the area around present-day Pueblo; the Spanish and French sent explorers here; and the site's steady traffic made it a perfect location for nineteenth-century traders from Mexico and the United States. By the 1890s the railroads, built along the two timeless footpaths, were carrying immigrant workers from around the world to Pueblo. Today this welcoming junction of mountain and plain bears the influence of more than thirty nations.

Pueblo  

Pueblo's frontier precursor, El Pueblo (1842-1854), counted African Americans, Mexicans, Anglos, and Indians among its ever-changing residents. The city that eventually grew here boasted even greater ethnic diversity. Vast waves of immigrants came to Pueblo in the late nineteenth century, landing in Smelter Hill's shanties, then moving up as their prospects improved. These new Americans - Italians, Irish, Slovenians, Welsh, Germans, Greeks, Russians, Southern and Eastern European Jews, and Japanese - found plentiful work in the smelters and rail yards, and they added immeasurably to the city's cultural life. Pueblo's Italian stonemasons constructed many of Pueblo's buildings; Hispanos contributed to livestock raising practices and labor for the railroad; the first Slovakian Eastern Orthodox church in Colorado was built in Pueblo in 1899; and all groups had thriving businesses, newspapers, and civic organizations. Thousands came to Pueblo in search of the American dream of freedom and opportunity. While for some the search was fruitless, for many more the dream proved a reality. Today many of their descendants are civic and cultural leaders. 

Pueblo's lavish Mineral Palace (est. 1891) featured shrines to King Coal and Queen Silver. How apt - for coal was literally king in Pueblo, and hard metals made the town glitter. Incorporated in 1860 as a ranching and supply town, Pueblo soon became Colorado's capital of heavy industry. Its furnaces glowed around the clock, employing 8,000 workers and producing such quantities of iron and steel that the city grew famous as the ""Pittsburgh of the West."" But the catastrophic flood of 1921 staggered Pueblo, and the Great Depression shuttered many of its businesses. By 1943 the Mineral Palace was gone, along with the wealth it embodied. Pueblo began to retool in the 1980s, mining resources such as art, culture, recreation, and tourism to manufacture a new age of prosperity.

Railroads  

Pueblo's leaders put up $50,000 to lure the Denver &amp; Rio Grande to town in 1872. What an investment! The railroad not only transported cattle, but fed ores to local smelters that fashioned these raw materials into rails, spikes, and pistons. D&amp;RG magnate William Jackson Palmer founded Pueblo's first steel plant, which later evolved into mighty Colorado Fuel and Iron - by 1900 among the world's largest steel producers. Four other railroads connected Pueblo to distant markets, fueling commerce and employing thousands of workers. The industry sagged during the Great Depression but bounced back briefly during World War II, when trains delivered munitions to the Pueblo Army Ordnance Depot. Though the railroads' passenger heyday ended after the war, freight cars still rumble through Pueblo, a routine nearly as old as the city itself.  

Union Avenue and Depot 
Erected in 1889, Pueblo's Union Depot was an emblem of civic pride, complete with Romanesque architecture, stained-glass windows, and a 150-foot-high clock tower. For sheer grandeur, few Colorado buildings could match it. And few streets could match the bustle of Union Avenue, a teeming promenade lined with hotels, shops, and restaurants. It was the flourishing heart of a flourishing city. However, the 1921 flood (which soaked the depot in eleven feet of water), the Great Depression, and the railroad's postwar decline took their toll; by 1971 Union Depot stood empty, and the once-handsome Avenue was vacant and deteriorating. But Puebloans fought to restore luster to the neighborhood. Designated a National Historic District in 1982, Union Avenue is again a prestige destination, and the rehabilitated depot sparkles, wearing its heritage proudly.

-72.649052,41.560165,Middletown in the 1800s,"On Main Street, Middletown, (On the right when traveling north)","The 1800s brought enormous change to Middletown, transforming its economy, its culture, and the very face of its people.   
The changes began in 1807, when hostilities between the United States and Great Britain led Thomas Jefferson to ban international commerce. For Middletown, the result was disaster. The city's prosperity hinged on maritime trade which now decreased drastically. At the same time, many of Middletown's old farming families found there was not enough land left for their children to establish their own farms. With prospects dim, many Middletown inhabitants left for the more promising frontiers of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.   
But new livelihoods soon replaced farming and maritime trade. Local entrepreneurs opened factories to manufacture everything from pistols to pumps, from swords to suspenders. Many factories employed young women, in addition to men. In the stone quarries across the river, demand skyrocketed for brownstone to build homes and public buildings throughout the United States. Immigration solved the resulting need for labor. Refugees from the Irish potato famine began arriving in Middletown in large numbers in the late 1840s to work in the quarries and as domestic servants. By 1850 more than 650 of the town's 8,400 residents were Irish immigrants. The following year Middletown decreased in area when the northern section became the separate town of Cromwell. Transportation, which had largely consisted of sailing ships, and horses and carts, now advanced dramatically. Beginning in 1822, steamboats carried passengers and freight from Middletown to Hartford and New York. Trains first ran through the city in 1849, and in 1872 the new Airline Railroad bridge spanned the river for the first time. In 1896, a bridge to carry pedestrians and vehicles opened. The 1890s brought electric-powered trolleys to the city, allowing townspeople to travel quickly and easily to places such as Lakeview Park (now Crystal Lake), for picnics, swimming and boating.   
During the 1830s Middletown became a center of the controversial crusade to abolish slavery in the United States. Blacks and whites men and women, risked insult and even assault for speaking out against slavery. They also helped fugitive slaves reach freedom via the secret, illegal network known as the underground railroad.   
When Wesleyan University opened here in 1831, Middletown achieved prominence in education, reinforced in 1840 with the establishment of Connecticut's first high school. Other important institutions followed: the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane (now Connecticut Valley Hospital) opened in 1868 and the Connecticut Industrial School for Girls, predecessor of the modern Connecticut Juvenile Training School was established in 1870. Russell Library opened its doors in 1875, and Middlesex Hospital was incorporated in 1895.   
When the clash between North and South erupted into the Civil War, Middletown threw itself behind the Union cause. Out of a population of 9,000 Middletown sent 958 men into the military. More than 100 Middletown soldiers died in the conflict. On the homefront, local women rolled bandages, stitched shirts, and knitted socks for the troops. Women with husbands in the army found new independence and responsibility in running their households and raising their children alone.   
In 1866 the incorporation of the city's southwestern section as the town of Middlefield completed the shrinking of Middletown. In other ways, however, the post-Civil War era was one of growth for the city. Existing factories expanded and new ones opened, making bicycles hammocks, rubber boots, and silver-plated tea sets. Immigrants from Germany, Sweden Poland, Italy, and Russia flocked to Middletown The establishment of churches for the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and other faiths reflected the city's increasing multiculturalism.   
Local artist Patrick Shugrue painted this view of Middletown as it would have appeared in 1899, looking east from Broad Street. It was a colorful city quickly expanding with immigrants from such  
Lands as Sweden, Russia, China, Italy, Poland and Greece. Residential neighborhoods stood side-by-side with factories and businesses, and the Connecticut River was still an integral part of the community.

In 1776, Bigelow died suddenly, leaving his wife Elizabeth with four children to support. Widow Bigelow decided to operate the tavern herself.    
It was not long before Mrs. Bigelow's political activities nearly put her out of business. The Revolutionary War had begun, and people in Middletown noticed that the Bigelow tavern seemed to be a meeting place for Tories (those who were loyal to Great Britain). Local citizens signed a petition claiming that Widow Bigelow had ""entertain’d at unseasonable hours of the night known enemies” to the American cause, and demanded that she “bee restrained immediately from keeping Tavern.” Mrs. Bigelow must have mended her ways, for she continued to run her tavern for nearly four more decades.    
Tavernkeeping was one of the few occupations open to women in the 1700s, when most females were limited to a career in housewifery (managing a home and raising children). In 1761, women operated three of Middletown’s eleven taverns.    
Career Women In Early Middletown
Although it was unusual, local women occasionally had other careers in the 18th century. In 1788, 25-year-old Elizabeth deKoven divorced her husband for desertion, and opened a store on Main Street selling luxury goods imported from Europe. The daughter of a wealthy merchant, deKoven had resources that most women of her time did not.   
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, a handful of Middletown women were teachers, occasionally in the town's public schools (attended by both boys and girls) but more often in small private schools for ""young ladies."" Middletown's well-to-do families sent their daughters to such schools to learn needlework and painting in addition to academic subjects.    
A Lost Neighborhood
This open plaza was once a busy road called Center Street, which ran from Main Street east towards the river. In the early 1900s, Center Street became a thriving immigrant neighborhood, home to countless Italian families who came from the town of Melilli, Sicily. Several tenement houses lined the street, providing housing for the recent immigrants. The neighborhood was demolished in 1961 as part of the city's redevelopment plan.

-72.652973,41.56631,St. John Church,"On St. Johns Square, Middletown, (On the right when traveling west)","The potato famine that ravaged Ireland in the late 1840s brought poverty and starvation to the Irish people. To survive, more than a million Irish fled their home coming to America on vessels so crowded and disease-ridden that they were termed ""coffin ships.”    
Hundreds of Irish immigrants came to Middletown. Many of the men took back-breaking, dangerous jobs in the brownstone quarries across the river in Portland, while the women often became domestic servants or took in laundry. Most of the Irish families settled in Middletown's North End.   
The famine Irish were the first large group of non-English, non-Protestant immigrants to arrive in Connecticut, and many local people were suspicious of the newcomers who were for the most part illiterate, malnourished, desperately poor and Catholic.   
By 1850, Middletown was home to nearly 700 Irish-born residents (almost eight percent of the city's population), and their numbers continued to grow. In spite of their poverty, Middletown's Irish immigrants were able to build a majestic Catholic church. St. John Church opened in 1852 with seating for a thousand worshippers – testimony to its members' faith and determination. Many of the parishioners were stone workers who volunteered their labor to build the church out of brownstone donated by owners of the quarries in which they worked.   
Architect Patrick Keely, himself an Irish immigrant, designed St. John Church. In 1872 the church erected a convent just east of here, and in 1888 opened the parochial school before you.   
A stone’s throw down Main Street stands the Fire Department headquarters, built in 1899. At the turn of the 20th century children gathered there every evening to watch an exciting spectacle, the nightly fire drill. At the blast of the fire whistle, two teams of enormous horses thundered out, pulling the brass pumper and the long hook-and-ladder. As firefighters urged them on, the horses galloped down Main Street, with bells clanging and pedestrians dashing out of the way.   
Old St. John's Cemetery
The poignant stories of many of Middletown’s earliest Irish families can be read on the gravestones of Old Cemetery, just behind the church. John and Mary Hennessey's family monument reveals the deaths of seven of their children, six of whom died before their sixth birthdays. The stone of 18 year-old Dennis Deegan, the son of Irish immigrants, records his death while a Union drummer in the Civil War.   
Most of those who came here to escape the ""Great Hunger,"" as the potato famine was known, never returned to their homeland. But their affection for Ireland remained strong, as indicated by the many that list counties, towns and even parishes in which the immigrants were born. In a strange twist, many of Middletown's Irish came from Middleton in County Cork.   
A Neighborhood of Immigrants
Middletown's first immigrants – English colonists who arrived in the 1650s – established their settlement in this vicinity, laying out their homelots and building their first meetinghouse nearby. Two centuries later, Middletown’s North End again became home to immigrants when Irish and Scottish families moved into the area.   
By the early 1900s, a thriving Italian community filled the Green Street, Rapallo Avenue and Ferry Street neighborhoods. Tenements housed recent immigrants and Italian-owned businesses soon flourished. People of Italian descent continue to be a strong presence in Middletown's North End, which in recent decades also has become home to new arrivals of Latino and Southeast Asian ancestry.   
Six days a week, laborers descended on long ladders into Portland's brownstone quarries, cutting the stone that was in great demand for elegant townhouses, churches and public buildings from New York to San Francisco. Beginning in the 1840s, hundreds of Irish immigrants became quarry workers, enduring constant danger and eleven-hour days of back-breaking labor for low pay.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=98606,the Middlesex County Historical Society,,"Churches, Etc.,Settlements & Settlers","This page was last revised on  October 10, 2016.

Then, at the turn of the 20th century, the trickle of immigrants became a virtual flood. Hundreds of families from the small town of Melilli, Sicily began arriving in Middletown and soon created a strong, close knit community.  
The story of the Melillese emigration began with Angelo Magnano, who came to America from Melilli in the 1880s, and settled in Middletown in 1895, working as a barber. According to tradition Magnano sent letters home to friends and family in Melilli, urging them to come to Middletown, where opportunities were much greater than in their native village.  
The Melillese began arriving here just before 1900, their numbers quickly swelling. Between 1900 and 1910, Middletown's population increased twenty percent – thanks in large part to the new settlers from Melilli. For many years, Middletown's Italians worshiped at St. John's Church, whose congregation was predominantly Irish. But the Melillese brought with them the traditions of their hometown which included loyalty to their patron saint, Sebastian.  
The feast of St. Sebastian, an annual festival celebrated for generations in Melilli, soon became a tradition for Middletown's Italian residents. In its early years the feast lasted three days and included fireworks, music, and a parade in which parishioners carried a statue of St Sebastian through the streets.  
With funds raised by the feast, Middletown's Italian community began planning their own church, In 1931, it built the present St. Sebastian Church, a replica of the church in Melilli. Skilled craftsmen from the congregation volunteered their services in the building's construction, which included Italian marble inside, a granite exterior, and a tile roof.  
At the start of the 21st century, the number of Middletown residents claiming ancestry in Melilli was greater than the entire population of the sister village in Italy.   
Kidcity and the Nuns
The cheerful building that now rings with the laughter of hundreds of children every day was once considerably quieter. Kidcity Children's Museum, just a few steps east of here, occupies an 1835 home that served as St. Sebastian's convent for many years.  
The house originally stood here beside the church on the corner of Broad and Washington Streets. After St. Sebastian's closed the convent, the founders of Kidcity ranged to have the stately house moved onto Washington Street, and renovated as a children's museum.     
Many of Middletown's Italian immigrant families originally settled in the neighborhoods east of Main Street: Green Street, Rapallo Avenue, and Center Street, among them. Their children often gathered at the Wadsworth Playground at the corner of Court Street and Dekoven Drive. This 1924 photograph captured a group of boys planning some mischief – or maybe just a ballgame.

The former St. Sebastian's convent made its way down Washington Street in March of 1997, on its way to becoming Kidcity Children's Museum. Complications during the move forced the old house to spend a night balanced in the middle of Washington Street, but today it is firmly on its foundation, filled with children exploring and enjoying its exhibits.

-72.649348,41.556341,Congregation Adath Israel,"On Broad Street, Middletown, (On the right when traveling north)","Rose Schwartzbuch had been in the United States seven years when she married Harry L. Shapiro in 1911, one of the first weddings to be held at Middletown's newly formed Congregation Adath Israel, then located on Union Street. The bridal couple, like those attending their nuptial celebration, was part of a wave of primarily Polish and Russian Jews who immigrated to Middletown between 1895 and 1920 seeking religious freedom and economic opportunity.  
Before 1900, few Jews lived in Connecticut. During the Colonial era Congregationalism reigned, and the state's constitution did not explicitly grant Jews the right to organize into religious societies until 1843. By the mid-1800s, Jewish immigrants from Germany and Austria-Hungary began arriving in Middletown in small numbers, followed by a large influx from Eastern Europe at the end of the century.  
Some of those first Eastern Europeans settled first in Portland, attracted to the work available at the town's Eastern Tinware Company, which actively recruited workers as they arrived at Ellis Island. The first shul, or synagogue, was housed in a commercial building in Portland. But Middletown's thriving economy soon lured most of the Portland Jews across the river. By 1905, a vibrant community of 80 families developed in the South End, where Jewish owned grocery shops, bakeries, and dry goods stores dotted Sumner, Union, and South streets.  
These immigrant Jewish families worshiped in private homes and rented rooms until Connecticut's General Assembly approved the incorporation of Congregation Adath Israel in 1905. Three years later, the congregation purchased its first permanent home, a former two-family house on Union Street. Close to homes and businesses, the location allowed members of the congregation to walk to services on the Sabbath, according to Orthodox Jewish law. The dedication in 1929 of this synagogue anchoring South Green's northwest corner firmly established Judaism as a partner in the city’s diverse religious community.  
With a traditional chupa over their heads, Jewish immigrants Rose Schwartzbuch and Harry Shapiro exchange wedding vows in 1911 surrounded by fellow members of the Congregation Adath Israel. According to Orthodox custom, during religious services women were seated in the balcony separate from the men on the main floor. Adath Israel joined the Conservative movement in 1942.

The Trolley
Making its appearance in the 1890s, the electric-powered streetcar made it possible for Middletonians for the first time to move about easily and cheaply. People crowded different trolley lines to get around town and to enjoy themselves at the popular Lakeview Park, now Crystal Lake, where the trolley company operated an amusement hall. They also could make trolley connections to Hartford, Berlin and Meriden.  
For this scenic view of the trolley making its way around south Green, an unknown artist added snow and other wintery elements to a photograph taken in summer. The retouched image was printed as a postcard in 1908.   
South Green &amp; The Sabbath
For centuries, Middletown residents of many faiths have chosen to build their houses of worship in this neighborhood around South Green.  
In 1741, more than 4,000 people jammed the green to hear minister George Whitfield preach the ecstasies of salvation. Whitfield and Connecticut native Jonathan Edwards were two of the leaders of the Great Awakening, a passionate evangelical movement which challenged the authority of the Congregational Church establishment. Swayed by the Great Awakening, a group of Middletown dissenters in 1747 formed the Strict Congregational Society, later known as South Congregational Church. They built their second meetinghouse in 1830 at South Green's southwest corner, and in 1867 constructed the present brick church, with its graceful spire, on the same site.  
In the mid-1700s, more English settlers came to Middletown, mostly seeking economic, not religious, opportunity. Those who followed the Church of England, or Episcopal Church, built their first house of worship on South Green in 1755. The present Episcopal Church, the Church of the Holy Trinity now stands on Main Street.  
On South Green's north side stands the First United Methodist Church, a stately granite structure built in 1931. It is the congregation's fourth church on the site; Middletown's Methodist Society built it’s first house of worship here in 1804.

Croatian immigrants began settling in Allegheny City (now Pittsburgh's North Side) in the late nineteenth century, after their government deprived its citizens of political power, agricultural markets, and land ownership. Many of the immigrants were farmers from the Jaska region, where the economy was particularly hard hit by the ruination of its vineyards. Nearly all the worker immigrants were unskilled men, and one third were illiterate. The displaced Croats hoped to earn enough money in America that they might one day return to their homeland. In the spirit of non-permanence, most of the Croatian immigrants rented their living quarters, sometimes living in boarding houses with as many as dozen other working men. 
 
In 1894, the increasing number of Croatian immigrants in Allegheny City formed St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Parish, which was the first Croatian national parish in the United States. Named for the patron saint of Jaska, the parish held church services in a house until a larger building could be obtained. 
 
It was not long before the parish outgrew its small building, necessitating the construction of a larger edifice. Divided over where the new church ought to be constructed, the parish split and built two churches in 1900-1901 - one in Allegheny City and the other in Millvale. 
 
The Allegheny City (North Side) congregation also built a rectory immediately west of the church in (1900-1901). In 1931, the parish purchased the local public school (located immediately east of the church and pictured right) and converted it to an eight-grade parochial school. 
 
A convent was built in 1950 to house the sisters who taught at the school. An elaborate hillside grotto, dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, was developed in 1944 between the church and the rectory.

The right panel of the mural portrays life in Ireland during the period of the Great Hunger showing row houses in Galway, an eviction scene and a contemporary newspaper depiction of some of the millions who immigrated to America from the late 1840’s through the end of the century. 

The middle panel portrays the often terrifying voyage across the Atlantic, in which thousands died from shipwreck and fevers. Those fortunate enough to escape often died in the notorious “coffin ships” that transported thousands to Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere. It is estimated that over 5,000 transatlantic crossing of ships loaded with Irish refugees were made between 1845-1851, approximately 2,000,000 persons per year. The use of unseaworthy vessels or passengers and crew succumbing to fevers en route resulted in the deaths of thousands. The scene here in a detail from British artist J.M.W. Turner’s painting “Slaveship” (1840). It selected for Turner’s particular ability to portray the violence of the sea, and the fact that some of the earliest “coffin ships” were actually retired British slavers employed to transport evicted Irish peasants.   

Having survived all of this, the newly arrived immigrants, many of who did not speak English, found that they were not entirely welcome. While many were not poor or unskilled, many others were agricultural workers who then found themselves competing for menial labor in America’s large cities. Both for comfort and protection, the Irish settled enclaves that became “Irish neighborhoods”.

-75.142206,39.947515,History of Scotland,"On Front Street, Philadelphia, (On the left when traveling south)","The Celtic influence permeated the British Islands several centuries before Christ, affecting the languages and culture of modern-day Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England. The Roman invasions of Britain resulted in the culture in southern Britain (England and Wales) being heavily influenced by the Roman culture of the conquerors.  
In northern Britain, however, the natives remained strong and independent. The Romans found these lands and these people too distant, too desolate, and possibly too dangerous to conquer. They sought instead to isolate the natives of north Britain, some of whom they called Caledonians, from the south by building Hadrian's Wall across the waist of Britain, and to influence them through diplomatic and other means.  
After about AD 400, Roman control waned in southern Britain. By 700 a new kingdom had grown up in lowland Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth line, its inhabitants being known as Picts, since the Romans named them 'Picti' in Latin due to their blue tattoos. In Argyll on the west coast, Gaels known in Latin as 'Scotti' had established Dalriada, a kingdom which the Picts conquered by 750. By 1000, Gaelic had become predominant in the Pictish kingdom (called 'Alba' in Gaelic), inspiring the later myth that the Pictish king Cinaed son of Alpin (Kenneth MacAlpine), who ruled from 842 to 858, had been a Dalriadan king who 'destroyed' the Picts. Alba became the basis of modern Scotland, eventually expanding into Northumbria in the southeast and Strathclyde in the southwest.

-75.142185,39.947327,Monument to Scottish Immigrants,"On Front Street, Philadelphia, (On the left when traveling south)","This Monument to Scottish Immigrants seeks to provide a broad perspective on the rise and the movement of the Scots over many continents and centuries. On either side of this Monument you will find Standing Stones which will assist you in understanding this ancient and ongoing process.  
The Standing Stones are part of the landscape and history of all the Celtic lands. Many remain in Scotland today. While the original purpose of these stones is not known, it is believed they served a spiritual purpose, and may have had scientific astronomical significance as well. We have adopted them in this Monument as symbolic of Scotland's ancient past.  
The Scots are sometimes reckoned to be 'Celtic' because the languages spoken in Britain at the time of Christ were closely related to that of the Celtae, a people of central France (then called Gaul). Other related languages were spoken in Ireland, in parts of Spain and Italy, and even in modern Turkey, where the name of the Celtic-speaking 'Galatians' (to whom St Paul wrote) can be compared to Galicia in Spain, to Gaul and to the Irish 'Gaels'. Those who spoke these languages sometimes shared other cultural traits, for example in their arts and crafts, probably due to idea-sharing among political and trading partners rather than invasions and migrations.  
In Scotland the Gaelic language became dominant by AD 1000, but previously it co-existed with dialects of the Celtic language known today as Welsh. By then, the English language advancing northwards from as early as AD 400, was spoken across much of southern Scotland. This 'Scots' English language grew increasingly dominant, especially in modern times, but many aspects of Scottish culture date from the days when Gaelic was more commonly spoken, and some of these have historically played an important role in shaping modern Scottish identities.

-75.142185,39.947327,Courage of the Scottish Immigrants,"On Front Street, Philadelphia, (On the left when traveling south)","During the first hundred years of Scottish immigration to the Americas, Philadelphia was the largest city in the British colonies, and the second largest city in the British empire. As such, its booming port was a natural destination for emigrant Scots. Many of those arriving in Philadelphia were poor or sick and in need of money, work, and friends. In 1747, a group of Scots immigrants who were already established in Philadelphia founded the St. Andrew's Society of Philadelphia to assist their indigent countrymen. The first meetings of the Society were held at Tun Tavern, which was located near this site. The early members of the Society included prominent Scottish immigrants -- physicians, educators, engineers, and military leaders, businessmen, clergymen, farmers, and lawyers -- all of whom contributed their money and skill to assist less fortunate Scots.  
This Monument depicts a Scottish family, newly arrived in Philadelphia, walking up from the river ready to face the challenges of their new country with determination and courage. The group includes a young man dressed in frontier garb who has come ahead of his family to find a place for them to settle. Perhaps he has already met and received help from the members of the St. Andrew's Society; perhaps he has joined the Society himself. Having found a suitable location in Pennsylvania or further West, he has sent word back to his family that the land is good, and that they should follow.  
His father, the patriarch of the family, retains his Celtic highland kilt, and proudly carries his cromag, or shepherd's staff and is accompanied by his faithful deerhound. The young woman is the wife of the patriarch's son, holding a baby that will grow to adulthood as an American. The young girl, perhaps an older daughter of the son, or his younger sister, carries a book which may be the family Bible. As a result of the Scottish passion for education, even the poorest of the Scots were literate, an advantage not shared by many new arrivals at that time.  
The Goal of this Monument is to recognize the courage, skill, resourcefulness and tenacity of Scottish Immigrants as a group. Having endured hardship, war, and persecution in their own land, they crossed the stormy Atlantic to settle here as frontiersmen, farmers and traders; as mothers, teachers, and nurses; as artisans, architects, physicians, attorneys, clergy, bankers, soldiers, and statesmen. No matter what their clan or profession, highland or lowland, all of these Scottish immigrants shared a common Celtic heritage, a common history of struggle, defeat, and victory, and a common desire to add their individual contributions to building a new and great nation.

-75.141861,39.947909,Arrival and Reception,"On Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, (On the right when traveling east)","The New World was often hostile to this flood of impoverished Irish immigrants. In America's cities, including Philadelphia, they arrived to face the native ""Know-Nothing"" movement, which defined ""American"" in terms that excluded the newly arriving Irish as ""papists,"" ""foreign paupers,"" ""a motley multitude."" Most came from rural, agricultural backgrounds, but they landed in an urban, industrial world. Many had never been more than twenty miles from home before undertaking the hazardous trans-Atlantic journey. Apprehensive, but eager to start a new life in freedom, they disembarked at ports like this one on the Delaware River in Philadelphia. However, when seeking employment, they were often greeted with the message ""No Irish Need Apply."" Yet, by 1850, eighteen percent of the population of Philadelphia was Irish. 
 • Attitudes toward the Irish were typified by an English commentator who described Irish immigrants as ""more like tribes of squalid apes than human beings."" A prominent Philadelphian wrote of the Irish that they had ""revolting and vicious habits. Being of the lower order of mankind, they were repellent to those who were further advanced in the social scale."" 
 • Philadelphia historian Dennis Clark summarizes their plight: ""The antipathy toward them rested not only on their reputation for violence and their religious difference from the bulk of the city's natives, but also upon their competition for jobs at the lower occupational levels, their menial status, their foreign aspect and clannishness.... To the grievous sufferings of the famine generation were added the cultural and class indictments of a largely hostile public opinion in the country to which they had fled.""

It celebrates their courage and honors them for opening the door for others. Their story springs from one dark period in the history of a distant island, but their journey and arrival changed the face of American life and forged an enduring link between Ireland and America. 
 • As it was for the Irish long ago, America remains a hopeful refuge from suffering and injustice. The Irish experience, its traumas and its triumphs, stands as a model from which we can learn and grow. ""The Irish, by being the first and the largest urban minority group with which American society had to deal, and by working their way into the general society, would constitute an example for the array of other immigrants who would follow them"" (Dennis Clark). 
 • In 1994, speaking at the site of a quarantine station at Grosse Isle, Quebec, where 5,300 Irish died in 1847, Mary Robinson, President of Ireland, challenged her listeners to be participants in history rather than mere spectators: ""If we are participants then we realize there are no inevitable victims....If we are participants, we engage with the present in terms of the past."" 
 • In looking at this monument on the edge of a river in a great American city, we honor the past, but we are also challenged to look at the present and to the future. For the most part, the children and grandchildren of the Hunger immigrants have prospered and are grateful for the bountiful blessings of America. 
 • We must be mindful that prejudice still exists, especially toward newly arrived immigrants. Let this memorial serve as a beacon of hope to all who come here. To them we say in greeting: ""Céad míle fáilte!"" One hundred thousand welcomes!

-76.60189,39.28502,Discover Little Italy: A Taste of the Past,"On Albemarle Street, Baltimore, ","Baltimore’s vibrant and diverse neighborhoods evolved to accommodate a constant influx of newcomers searching for opportunity. Between 1830 and 1917, more than two million immigrants landed in Baltimore, which was second only to New York as a port of entry for many years. Most new arrivals promptly boarded the B&amp;O Railroad and headed west, but many stayed to work in the city’s growing industries. Irish, German, East European, Greek, and Italian immigrants added their customs, religions, and cuisines to Baltimore’s colorful tapestry of neighborhoods.  

Today, Little Italy is one of Baltimore’s most renowned ethnic neighborhoods, but through most of the 19th century, it contained an integrated mix of immigrants and native Baltimoreans, black and white. After 1881, when the archdiocese constructed St. Leo’s Roman Catholic Church (225 South Exeter Street) specifically for Italian immigrants, the neighborhood became Baltimore’s foremost Italian enclave. Ever since, neighborhood life has centered on St. Leo’s and its many activities: religious services, primary and secondary education, after-school programs, English classes, festivals, and Saturday haircuts. The bocce ball courts in the 900 block of Stiles Street also remain popular.  

From the streets of Little Italy, pasta and politicians rose to fame. A multitude of restaurants grew out of small mom-and-pop grocery stores in response to demand from Little Italy’s many boarding houses and the nearby President Street Railroad Station. Nationally prominent politicians got there start her. Vincent L. Palmisano, who lived at 320 South High Street, served as the nation’s first Italian-born U.S. Congressman from 1926 to 1938. Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. served as U.S. Congressman from 1939 to 1947 and as Baltimore’s mayor from 1947 to 1959. His son, Tommy D’Alesandro III, was mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971. D’Alesandro Jr.’s daughter, Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi (D-CA), became the first female minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002.

-76.61525,39.28969,Building a City and a Nation: At the Crossroads,"On North Charles Street, Baltimore, ","Twice in the 20th century, Baltimoreans completely reinvented their downtown-by necessity in the early 1900s and by plan mid-century. 

In 1904, Baltimore’s downtown vanished when 140 acres were destroyed by fire. Within ten years, Baltimore had replaced approximately 1,500 burned-out buildings with 750 much larger structures. Several of Baltimore’s most significant institutions relocated to this intersection, the central crossroads of the City.  

Directly north of Baltimore Street, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad built one of the country’s first high-rise railroad office buildings. Completed in 1906, the building symbolized the B&amp;O Railroad’s status as a national rail power and the builder of the fist long-distance railroad in the world. The wealth of the B&amp;O Railroad helped finance the extraordinary economic and cultural growth of the 19th century Baltimore.   

Diagonally across Charles Street from the B&amp;O Railroad building, the Savings Bank of Baltimore building, built in 1907, resembles a small temple on the Acropolis in Athens. Copies of ancient temples suggested permanence and stability, characteristics important to financial institutions. Immediately south of the bank, the 1912 Hansa Haus was built for the North German Lloyd Steamship Company, which began service between Baltimore and Bremen, Germany in 1868. The steamship line and the B&amp;O Railroad connected Europe to America’s Midwest, making Baltimore a major port-of-entry for European immigrants.   

Between 1958 and 1975, Baltimoreans again reshaped much of downtown with the award-winning Charles Center Plan that called for ambitious new architecture and urban planning. The Mechanic Theater, located directly behind this sign, was designed in 1967 by world renowned architect John M. Johansen on the former site of the Baltimore Sun building. Built in the “Brutalist” style of architecture, the theater’s form allowed its interior space to determine its exterior shape.   

(Inscription under the images on the left)  (Image 1) From 1820 to 1920, close to two million immigrants entered Baltimore, many of whom came on North German Lloyd Steamship Line. Germans, Poles, Bohemians, Bavarians and other Europeans immigrated to the U.S. through Baltimore. The picture above shows immigrants waiting to debark at Locust Point, ca. 1904. The women are wearing Kopftuch, traditional head scarves that were popular in Middle and Eastern Europe. On return trips from Baltimore, the steamship company transported tobacco, wheat, fertilizer, coal, and steel to Bremen.   

(Image 2) Thurgood Marshall (1908-1993), born and raised in Baltimore, became America’s first African American Supreme Court Justice in 1967. In the mid-1930s, Thurgood Marshall’s law office was located on the sixth floor of 4 East Redwood Street.   

(Image 3) The Hansa Haus was symbolically named for the Hanseatic League, a medieval confederation of northern German cities. The architectural firm Parker, Thomas, and Rice modeled the building after the 16th century German half-timbered architecture. The building however, is constructed of reinforced concrete. The same firm also designed the B&amp;O Railroad and Savings Bank of Baltimore buildings.  

(Image 4) This striking twenty-ton statue decorated the main entrance to the B&amp;O Railroad building. The figure on the left is Mercury, the messenger of the gods and god of travelers, roads, merchants, and commerce. The figure on the right, not positively identified, is most likely a 20th century Americanized Mercury. With his right arm draped over a locomotive and is left hand holding an electric torch, he represents the vitality and future of America.   

(Image 5) Following the 1904 Fire, the Baltimore Sun relocated to this corner of Baltimore and Charles streets. In 1906, the Sun building opened with news headlines touting it as “a Twentieth century home.” A.S. Abell founded the Sun in 1837, and during the 1840’s, it became the newspaper of choice for politicians in Washington D.C., and the first paper in the country to use the telegraph for news gathering.

For many years, this boarding station helped to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the United States. From 1783 to 1971, officers working at this station boarded and inspected thousands of ships coming into New York Harbor each year. In the mid-late 1880’s, the majority of immigrants arriving to the United States entered through New York Harbor and were subject to inspection. Using a tugboat, a team of medical officers travelled into the harbor to inspect incoming vessels and their passengers. If the ships passed inspection, they were given a clean bill of health and could continue. If deadly and contagious diseases were present, the vessels were fumigated and the passengers quarantined until it was safe for them to land in New York. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Yellow fever, cholera, typhus, small pox, diphtheria, and measles were among the diseases requiring quarantine.

The first quarantine law for New York Harbor was passed by the Colonial Legislature in 1758. It quarantined vessels at Bedloe’s Island (now Liberty island). In 1801, a quarantine station at Tomkinsville (sic), Staten Island, was established as the location for quarantine facilities. It was destroyed by arson in 1858. Earlier quarantine facilities failed because nobody wanted to live near hospitals full of highly contagious immigrants. For this reason, between 1870 and 1873, the State of New York built two islands for quarantine purposes: Hoffman Island for healthy passengers on quarantined ships, and Dix (Swinburn) Island for the sick passengers. The facilities on the island included dormitories, kitchens, dining rooms, a laundry, disinfecting and drying chambers, hospital wards, a crematory and a mortuary.  
Rosebank 
The Rosebank Boarding Station included building used as residences for the medical officers, a laundry, carpenter shop, boathouse, telegraph office and observation tower, laboratory, storerooms and a barn. The facility housed medical officers who would be available on short notice to examine passengers and inspect and fumigate vessels. Rosebank laboratory staff continuously tested rats collected from vessels to monitor for plague infestation. The State of New York sold the property to the United States in 1921, and the Public Health Service continued operations and improved efficiency by constructing new buildings and dormitories. The facility later became part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and it was closed in 1971 along with the majority of the nation’s Quarantine stations as the result of a federal quarantine change that reduced disease inspection in favor of other forms of intervention.",https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=103809,,,Science & Medicine,"This page was last revised on  June 6, 2017.

Christian Heigold, a German immigrant and stonecutter, came to Louisville sometime prior to 1850, and in 1857 he built his home at 264 Marion Street in an area known as the Point. 
This was a period of unrest and attacks on Irish and German immigrants, not long after the infamous Bloody Monday incident in 1855. In order to prove his patriotism and loyalty to America, he carved inscriptions and busts of American notables into the facade of the house. Among the incised mottos is one reading, ""Hail to the City of Louisville."" Heigold died shortly after the facade was completed in 1865, and his son Charles lived there until his death in 1925. 
The Heigold house was one of only a few structures on the Point to survive the Great Flood of 1937, and the only one still inhabitable. The house survived until 1953 when the city purchased the property in order to expand the city dump.

-92.202843,47.68998,Hanka Homestead,"Near Pylka Road, Embarrass, ","Times were tough in the life of an immigrant farmer in northeastern Minnesota. Subsistence farming was a way of life that had gone on for centuries in Finland. Immigrants knew what was needed to survive in the harsh climate of the area. All family members old enough to work - men, women and children - did their share in clearing the land and creating a homestead. Facing thin rocky soil and a short growing season, immigrants in Embarrass planted potatoes, which became the major cash crop of the farms, supplemented by hay, rye, oats, and wheat. 

Finnish immigrant farmers began settling regions of St. Louis County in the late 1800's. They purchased their homesteads from private properties and through the provisions of the Federal Homestead Act of 1862. Many Finnish immigrants moved to the rural homesteads to escape poor wages and unhealthy conditions in the mines on the Vermilion and Mesabi Iron Ranges. Others took up the life of backwoods farmers for ethnic, political or religious reasons and the desire to own their own land, even if one's claim was no larger than 40-80 acres.  

At the age of 26, Gregorius Hanka married Mary Stierna. Together they purchased an 80 acre parcel of land from the Duluth and Iron Range Railroad. While staying with neighbors, the Hankas erected a one-room log house built of logs short enough for one man to lift and tight enough to survive the cold winds of winter. By 1915, several other buildings were built, including a sauna, hay barn and cattle barn.  

Finnish folk building form, arrangement and farming practices were etched in the memories of the immigrants as they worked on ""proving up"" their homestead claims by erecting small houses and clearing the land for cultivation.  

The Hanka homestead includes ten buildings, four of which are made of logs. As was common in western Finland, the homestead formed a U-shaped courtyard consisting of the house, sauna and a double-pen barn in the center of the farmstead. Open hay fields surround the farm, with a log hay barn located about 500 feet southeast of the house. This illustrates the common practice by Finns of erecting several buildings, each with their own special function. The hay barn in the field, at a considerable distance from the house, is also based on the Old World arrangement of farm buildings, with the added benefit that if the barn went up in flames, the other buildings would not.  

Architecturally, the Hanka farm buildings embody the traditional, distinctive construction techniques used by the Finnish immigrants at the turn of the century. Chinkless log walls and double-notched corners indicate a rich array of building skills borrowed from their native Finland. The logs used were often from the trees which did not have the market value of other woods, such as tamarack, or the pine and poplar found in nearby woods.

Native Americans 
American Indians were among the first people to call this area home. The earliest date back to 9,500 B. C. Numerous Indian communities continued to live off these lands, until the early 1800s. The Cherokee, Osage, Quapaw, Tunica and Koroa Indians are among the most well-known area tribes.   
European explorers  
Hernando DeSoto was the first European documented to have crossed the Mississippi River. 
When he got to the river he was met by an armada of American Indians, 2,500 strong.-all in dugout canoes.   

Exploration of the Mississippi River 
The Frenchmen Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet traveled down the Mississippi as far as the Arkansas River in 1673. Another French explorer, Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, sailed down the river to its delta in 1682. When he got there, La Salle claimed the entire Mississippi region for France.  

Immigrants in the Arkansas Delta 
Over the years, immigrants came to eastern Arkansas for many reasons. They relied heavily on the Mississippi River to get here and then later for work. Communities often emerged along the banks of the river, which provided a steady source of food and water. 

People who help write chapters in the Delta’s remarkable story:
Irish, German, Swiss, Italian, Slovakian, Greek, Lebanese, Chinese, French, African Americans, Lydian  

Fighting for control 
The river’s coveted resources have sometimes been a source of contention. During the Civil War, for example, armies of the Confederate and Union States fought for control of the river. Helena was occupied by the Union Army from 1862-1865 and the Battle of Helena was fought on July 4, 1863, (the same day as Gettysburg and Vicksburg). There are 27 Civil War interpretive sites in Helena.

From 18th and 19th century landmarks to vestiges of an immigrant past, from signs of 20th ceentury decline to a bold 21st century rebirth, its streetscapes tell an epic story of urban change and diversity. 

Prominent Americans once lived here alongside ordinary people who strove to find their place in ""The Promised Land."" From the 1790s to 1830s, the neighborhood housed a vibrant mixture of wealthy elites, merchants, artisans, and laborers, including African Americans both free and enslaved. The richest man in America lived here: Charles Carroll, the only Roman Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence/ His neighbor, Mary Pickersgill, sewed the flag that inspired our National 
anthem. By the 1840s, the upper classes had departed, to be replaced by German and Irish immigrants. East Europeans and Italians arrivewd later in the century. By the early 1900s, Lombard Street had become the bustling market center of a sprawling immigrant Jewish communitiy 9and later earned the nickname ""Corned Beef Row"").  

Like other mid-20th century inner neighborhoods, Jonestown endured the exodus of city dwellers to suburbia and the upheavals of large-scale urban renewal. Public housing high rises reshaped the terrain, as did destruction from citywide riots following the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The neighborhood fought back, led by the Jonestown Planning Council, a national leader in grassroots organization. With its high rises replaced by mixed-income housing designed in Baltimore's traditional rowhouse style, a ""shipsteading"" initiative that re-established small businesses, and Heritage Walk- a project celebrating its many museums and historic sites-Jonestown has built on its past to rejuvenate itself.

 Behind you stands St. Dominic Church, established 1852. It anchors the city's only Dominican parish and is its sixth oldest Catholic church. St. Dominic's survived two upheavals — a fire in 1885 and the threat of urban renewal in the 1950s (thanks to friends in Congress — to prevail as a spiritual and community center. Throughout the 1800s it ministered to farmers, slaves, free blacks, and Irish, German, and Italian immigrants as well as native-born government workers and members of Congress. Since urban renewal, it has served its newest neighbors. This Gothic style structure was dedicated in 1875.

Neighbors of all faiths have appreciated St. Dominic's. ""The whole neighborhood would go to the carnival with its bright lights,"" recalled Larry Rosen who grew up on 4½ Street. The priests and nuns of St. Dominic's school taught hundreds of area children from 1852 until 1957, when the rectory, convent, and school were all demolished for the Southeast-Southwest Freeway. The 600 block of Seventh Street was designated for a new school, but because the new Southwest had fewer children, the parish asked to use the site for low-income housing. After years of litigation, developers instead completed Capital Square townhouses, sold at market rates in 2001.

 This quiet street was once Washington's answer to New York's Lower East Side. Fourth Street, known until 1934 as a 4½ Street, and nearly Seventh Street were Southwest's shopping centers.
 
 
Around 1900 this street was the dividing line between a mostly African American community living to the east and mostly Irish, Italian, and Jewish communities to the west. Yet black and white adults came together over life's necessities in the small shops along 4½ Street. Grocers, butchers, cobblers, and merchants supplied flour and sugar, fresh meat, clothing, and dry goods. German Jewish immigrants moved in during the Civil War, living above their small businesses. A larger wave of Eastern European Jews began arriving after 1880.
 
 This street was the center of Jewish life in Southwest, but it was never exclusive. The Jewell Theater, showing movies to African American audiences, once sat here across from today's Amidon Elementary School. Children played together in alleys and schoolyards, and roamed to the Mall to visit the Smithsonian museums or play on the open fields.
 
 Southwest's Jewish community produced a civic leader for the entire city, Attorney Harry S. Wender worked to make DC streets safer and to create playgrounds. In 1934, he helped bring black and white citizens together to persuade the city to tear up the worn-out cobblestones of 4½ Street, modernize it, and re-name it Fourth Street to symbolize its shiny new image. The whole neighborhood celebrated its rehabilitation with the first integrated parade in the city's history.

Byrd, Keter Betts, and Stan Getz introduced Americans to Brazilian jazz with their best-selling album Jazz Samba (1962). The album was recorded at nearby All Souls Unitarian Church. Byrd headlined at the Show Boat until it closed in 1967.
 
 The arts got a boost from Colin ""Topper"" Carew, a young architect who created the New Thing Art and Architecture Center. The New Thing (1966-1972) was innovative and free-form, offering arts programs for all ages. one of its five buildings was 2127 18th Street. Carew later became a film maker, contributing to the 1983 film D.C. Cab.
 
 As the New Thing was doing its thing, the Ambassador Theater produced rock concerts with psychedelic sound and light shows. Among the performers in 1967 was an obscure new group, the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
 
 GALA Hispanic Theatre opened in 1976 at 2319 18th Street, the home of founders Hugo and Rebeccca Medrano. Dance Place began at 2424 18th Street in 1890, and the city named the alley behind you in its honor.
 
 Also in this area was the Whitman-Walker Clinic, the health service for the gay and lesbian community. It operated its second facility at 2335 18th Street from 1980 until 1987. Here it developed its pioneering responses to the AIDS crisis.

 The charming Victorian rowhouses you see along 18th Street are an Adams Morgan signature. But they were nearly lost in the 1960s in the name of progress.
 
 During World War II, thousands flooded Washington to work for the government, seriously overcrowding existing housing. Afterward, planners and citizens considered how to repair Washington's beaten-down neighborhoods. In Southwest, they chose wholesale ""urban renewal."" Nearly all of Southwest was razed for new construction. Some 23,500 residents were forced out. Many came to already crowded Adams Morgan.
 
 Citizens and planners agreed: Adams Morgan would not be another Southwest.
 
 So in the early 1960s citizens formed the Adams Morgan Planning Committee to work with federal agencies to improve the neighborhood. With much debate, they first called for better shopping and community facilities, and less traffic. Early plans called for paved plazas and high-rises on 18th Street and Columbia Road. Reed-Cooke's industrial buildings (auto dealerships, power plants, and warehouses) and deteriorating housing would have been razed or re-used.
 
 But then residents realized that plans would displace thousands of Reed-Cooke residents and dozens of businesses. And private restoration efforts were already underway. So in 1965 the National Capital Planning Commission rejected urban renewal for the area.
 
 At the same time, many residents joined other Washingtonians to stop plans for a freeway alongside Florida Avenue to the south that would have cut off Adams Morgan from Downtown Washington.
 
 The neighborhood's ongoing citizen participation is an important legacy of urban renewal debates and highway battles.

 Across the street you can see the Marie H. Reed Community Learning Center. It opened in 1977 on the former sites of Morgan Community School and Happy Hollow Playground.
 
 Both the Adams and Morgan elementary schools became ""community schools"" in the 1960s. Their curricula and policies were controlled by locally elected residents with the cooperation of the D.C. School Board. The schools also provided important social services. The new Reed Center followed suit with a public health clinic, child care center, adult education, and swimming pool. Its name honors Bishop Marie H. Reed (1915-1969), founder of Sacred Heart Spiritual Center and leader of the community school movement.
 
 The original Morgan School was named after City Commissioner Thomas P. Morgan, whose Oak Lawn estate was on the site of today's Washington Hilton. At first Morgan School served white children. Then in 1929, when the John Quincy Adams School was built for them on 19th Street (Adams once owned land along Rock Creek), African American students were given the old Morgan School. By the 1950s, Washington's black schools were overcrowded and run down, while white schools were under-enrolled due to ""white flight"" to the suburbs.
 
 When the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was unconstitutional in 1954, Washington's schools were ordered to desegregate immediately as a model for the nation. Here, black and white community members had already laid the groundwork for better schools and improved race relations. In 1955 school officials and residents created the Adams Morgan Better Neighborhood Conference—and the Adams Morgan name stuck.

-90.588642,34.528513,The Irish Immigrant,"Near Pecan Street, Helena, (On the right when traveling south)","Patrick Ronayne Cleburne, the son of Dr. Joseph and
Mary Anne Ronayne Cleburne, was born March 17,
1828. At the age of twenty-one he immigrated to the
United States. He settled in Helena in 1850.  

The Son of Privilege 

Patrick Ronayne Cleburne was born into an Irish Protestant
family of high social standing. His father was a prosperous
doctor in County Cork and young Patrick received an
enviable education.  

When Patrick was fifteen, his father died. Against his wishes,
Patrick was apprenticed to a doctor. He cared little for
medicine and in 1846, he failed the exam for entrance to the
Apothecaries' Hall. Humiliated, Patrick joined the British
army. For three years he suffered the miserable life it afforded
enlisted men.  

Quitting Ireland 

The 1840s were years of political and social unrest in Ireland.
The situation worsened after the Irish potato crop failed in
1846. Patrick's brother, William, wrote in July 1849, ""It is the
wish of all my brothers and sister, to quit this country for
America."" On November 2, Patrick Cleburne and his siblings
William, Joseph and Anne, left Ireland. They arrived in New
Orleans on Christmas Day. Patrick Cleburne made his way to
Cincinnati, Ohio, where his medical training enabled him to
secure a job in a drugstore.  

Cleburne Settles in Helena 

In 1850, twenty-two year-old Patrick Cleburne moved to
Helena, Arkansas, where he found a job with the Grant and
Nash Drugstore. As store manager he received $50 a month,
a room at the rear of the shop, and his meals, which he took
with Dr. Grant. To Patrick Cleburne, the move probably
seemed like a simple chance for advancement, but it changed
the course of his life.

Refugees fleeing World War II and the Cold War in Eastern Europe were the first group to arrive. A small Czech community lived along Park Road until the 1990s. In the 1980s refugees from wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua found a home in Mount Pleasant. Good wages -- often ten times as high as in their native countries -- continue to lure immigrants from Central America. By the late 1990s, 30 percent of Mount Pleasant's population was Latino, adding flavor to the many grocery stores, restaurants and vendors along Mount Pleasant Street.
